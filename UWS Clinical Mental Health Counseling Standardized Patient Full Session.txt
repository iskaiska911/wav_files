Beth nice to see you again today it's nice to see you too you know this week I was reviewing our notes from last week just to remind me what we had covered we talked a lot in terms of mental performance about your focus how you are moving from nutritionist to physical therapist to coaching to your counseling appointments as you're sort of preparing yourself to get back on the tour and one thing I noticed that was absent from those notes is that I don't think I ever really asked you how you feel about returning to bowling or turning to the professional tour I I'm having a lot of feelings about it and a lot of them are surprising to me and I'm not having an easy time getting getting through those feelings you feel like you can share with me some of what those feelings are you know I think my husband and my kids blame me being on tour for getting so sick and so the thought of going back on tour I think scares them a little bit also I've I've got some guilt around it and and I I don't know what to do if I'm not onto her anymore I don't know who that person is wow I just heard a ton in your statement family is grumpy with you kids and husband which are sort of like two different types of guilt right yeah I heard some fear of not knowing what you would do if you didn't return to tour and I'm I'm still wondering if you also feel a little concerned that you delayed access to care because you were on tour am i hearing all those things correctly yeah I am as much as I don't wanna go there I'm asking myself that question you know would I have gotten so incredibly ill if I had taken care of myself sooner super honest question isn't it yeah sorry yeah raw I remember in your intake you told me that your mother dying of breast cancer at a fairly young age 47 Wow right at the time where your mom having children need your mom how does that play in to this rawness about whether or not you pursued care at the right time well I mean I know that I it was not something I wanted to focus on I wanted to move past it I wanted to show my kids you know people do die and you can move on and you can still have a life and you can do stuff and be effective you know but on the other end of it I think I just didn't want to think about that mobility mm-hmm I hear the mom part coming out I've got kids that knew their grandmother my job is to help them move through this grief I wonder if you ever moved through that grief now I think I just put it on hold and I just started focusing on my job sometimes I don't know if this is true for you but sometimes what happens is when we put grief on hold everything surrounding that issue it also gets put on hold so I'm thinking about you know the nitty-gritty do you avoid doing breast self-exams because mom died of breast cancer do you avoid going to the doctor regularly because mom died of breast cancer it's not just the grieving that we sometimes put on hold it's everything around a topic is that true for you or was it more just the grief I lied when I went to the doctor and I said that I did breast exams I've never done a breast exam by myself never embarrassed to say and yet you're saying it to me now why well I mean I feel like I trust you that I can I can I can say things that are hard to say to you because we've worked together yeah you know but thank you for that by the way yeah but I also I'm also just this really hard place in my life and I I know that the way that I've done things all along kind of needs to shift in some way so I don't get sick again or you know what I mean yeah and I I don't know what that looks like it's scary I don't want to put words in your mouth so remember you're always the final say on your experience in life you didn't just have breast cancer you had stayed for I mean from what you were telling me you went through chemo radiation multiple times through that you have had your breasts removed you've gone through all the scarring that that created and the treatment for that you've then had implants and all of the while battling to stay alive really battling to stay alive so I wonder if this reimagining of your life is so scary because you know the alternative like are you living your best self are you living your best life because now you know what the alternative looks like the stakes are really high tell me about those steaks what's gonna happen if you actually reimagined your life well I mean the way my marriage has always worked is that I go out and go on to her and he takes care of everything takes care of the kids he takes care of the house he takes care of paying the bills he takes care of everything and then when we when I get home we're really happy to see each other you know and I don't know what happens to my marriage if I'm at home all the time is he you don't want me to be around all the time is that the fear that exists just because it's a change in a pattern of behavior or have you seen signs that this could be an issue for in real life well he's just said to me many times I'm so I love our marriage it works so well for our family and you know I love missing you because I get to be so happy when you're home and and they've been through so much with this illness you know and I I just don't know what if my husband's gonna feel real crowded or if he's still gonna if he's still gonna want me the way he has I heard you as you were describing his comments about the life you had prior to the illness this little caveat and I don't know if it was his in his voice or yours that there was something about this quality of you being gone and then coming back that really matters I internally had a little sense of fear like oh gosh what does that actually mean am I reading that off you yeah tell me about that there's almost like an instinct that you know is under there that not quite saying I guess you know my body is different everything's different and that's been challenging enough for like my husband to see me undress or anything like that's been hard enough because you had to go a long time as well with the mastectomy before they did the breast implant that and then the scar is garvik and you know the radiation gives you burns all over them I mean it did it was horrible you're a different person physically yeah yeah so there's that and I feel like we're we're still working on overcoming that you know I am anyway he says he loves me no matter what and I believe him but at the same time I am really aware that in my body you know that your body is different so you get sard to accept that somebody else doesn't see it as vastly different yeah gotcha yeah or doesn't have that mental image of when it was so horrible you know when I was just my skin was burned basically and if you had the felt sense of it he just had the visual of it yeah yeah yeah so anyway there's that part that you know we have to work through and and I'm thinking like okay well that's hard enough if we change everything about excuse me if we change everything about the way our marriages functioned is our marriage gonna function does that make sense makes absolute sense and I think it's very thoughtful it's it's very challenging and I see the emotion that is connected with it and I think we could delve into 17 different parts of that but I have to say to you the fact that you're doing this questioning now is very brave because it would be as exhausted as you are I still think it would be easier to fall into your old patterns work with the coach go to the nutritionist get your energy back develop that arm strength again you could do all of that I can but that's not why you're in the chair like I think you're in the chair because you're trying to figure out is this really what you want and if in fact you have to acknowledge that it might not be you then risk everything that you look at the emotion that pops up when I say that take a breath what about what I just said had that impact on you I think it's just really can I take a clean absolutely it's just really you know if you keep moving forward it's like the grief with my mom you know I don't have to go there but when I think about stopping in my tracks and like everything behind you suddenly catches up like you fast braked in a car and all the groceries come flying forward yeah that's a great analogy cuz that's what it feels like and then I don't have any control you know and I I've had so little control with all the treatments and everything you know how I feel and that's really hard because you know I'm I'm an athlete I know the harder you work the better you get it gives you more control I can do something to improve this motion this behavior this outcome yeah but can adjust and get a different result you know not it what's interesting is not only would you have very little control but you'd also be forced not to act when you're too sick to do anything but vomit hard to make yourself feel better when your skin is burning and you don't want to be touched and you're trying to lay in a bed and not have the covers hit you look at that yeah so you have time to not just the lack of control but then time to ponder that's that's exactly what's going on is this is the first time in years maybe ever that I have all this time on my hands and I don't like it and it's not comfortable what does it feel like to hear me say that what you're describing really does sound very hard I mean it feels validating and sad it's it's much easier for me as an athlete to just say buck up walk it off you know kind of yeah so look at what you're doing right now right in the moment you're trying to compare and utilize the skill sets that you use for 20-plus years on the door that helped you be super successful and apply them to a reimagine life because you don't have much like guidelines there's no margin you can't quite figure out what that looks like well I've been following the same map my whole life my I don't have another map I don't know I don't know I don't know anything anymore we clearly know that you love and are committed to your husband and your marriage we clearly know that you love your children but let's imagine for a second that they didn't have an opinion that we absolutely knew that whatever decision you made they were going to be there in support of you okay so that we can sort of take them off the table just for a little bit okay then what what happens for you emotionally about where you're at you mean if I'm just thinking about what what you might want to do with your life I think I wit I wish I could give myself the space to think about that more I'm sorry that's not a great answer but I've never had that much I've never given myself room to to think I may I love the answer and by the way it doesn't matter if an answer is greater is not great right but what I love about that answer is it it seemed very honest meaning I don't even know how to do that is what you're telling me I don't I have no idea what it means to set aside my responsibilities to my husband and my children and our finances and our home and actually just focus right here on what this person in the chair wants yeah because even when I was really sick my my job was to get better mmm so it was always you know just got get better yeah and I'm thinking back to our very first intake session when I was asking you about the history with your own family their parents and you describe this amazing bond with your dad because he was you guys were bowling buddies right he was the guy who coached you from very little look at that beautiful smile but I'm gonna push you a little bit here okay I believe that you can have a great relationship with your dad but I wonder if he didn't set you up a little bit for a very early focus even in your youth on goal orientation rather than I want to say whole person development because he saw your skill set and wanted to help you become that bowler that you seemed passionate to be and yet from a very early age I think you told me 10 or 11 you guys started talking about pro bowling is it hard to hear that that yeah I feel myself getting a little mad mm-hmm because I love my dad and I and I know that he he did what he did B so that I could have a career and a life that was not just you know here your choices become a teacher go to nursing school you know my dad wanted me to imagine a life that was what I what I wanted what I was that yeah so I feel myself feeling defense yeah you get to I mean and you get to always remember tell me if you think I'm off I just started listening to your goal oriented language and thought would that goal oriented language be so embedded in you it's got a natural personality thing or is that just you've been working on a specific goal for a lot longer than you know most people have in their life I don't think I know that answer I mean maybe it's both I'm not I'm not really sure that's just when I think back as a kid that that's all I remember is that I've just been very driven and if you want something go after it work hard get it you know so that's just I don't know how much of that I have an idea yeah name another thing in life that you're so goal driven about other than bowling well putting putting away money for the college for kids for the financial management for your family yep you know making sure that they had everything they needed you know making sure that you know everybody was comfortable yeah you know so finances for your family yeah bowling which provides the finance part of the family and that you love don't want to just didn't demean that yes what about just you something really goal driven oriented passionate just related to the person of Rita hmm fitness but again that's also got to do with my job does it I mean I want to give you the leeway to really explore that yes Fitness relates to your to your work bowling do you think you would have a passion for fitness if that's not what you chose to do for a living in the future yeah I think I did I think that I like feeling strong and that was something I really missed when I got sick you know and so I always realized when I got so ill that I've always been a woman who's felt very physically you know strong I can I can pick this up I can do this you know sense of security and autonomy autonomy yeah yeah okay and so when I got so sick I lost that so now that I'm starting to rebuild that again yeah I realize how important it is to me I'm not sure if I answered your you did and I'm gonna sort of pull us out of the moment a purposefully for a second okay I don't know if you just realized what you did but you told me something about just you and your value without referencing the kids without referencing your husband and without relating it to bowling you just told me something that you would be passionate about as an individual okay I guess I did what is look at the smile what does that mean to you well it feels good it feels good to know that that I'm important to me to the things that I want and it's not just about taking care of everybody else you could find a piece one piece of a person that is just you just about you yeah and it didn't you didn't cry you didn't but crying's not bad but nothing horrible happened yeah yeah you're right I can see the smile you're getting what I'm saying even though I'm not really saying it well no I think you are I mean I yeah that's like a first step isn't it like a baby step about what do I want for me yeah so how do you know now that you know at least with this one tiny example that you can do this you can flush out the who of who you are yeah tell me about the very real situations with your husband your children that makes you have this concern that they might not be able to accept a new version of you the concern comes from the fact that when I was so sick and they were so supportive but you know it kills me that they saw me in such a weakened sick state when I've always been this rock for the family yeah and it was the look on their fet they were so scared of it it makes me feel like I don't want to I don't want them to worry about me feeling weak again like I don't do you know what I mean I I don't want that or being like oh my god is mom okay you know oh my god is my wife gonna be alright I that was just horrible the whole time I was sick was it horrible for you watching no I mean watching your mom be sick oh yeah did you watch her be sick or were you on to her I was not around for a lot of it she also hit a lot of it you know she's um I mean she was very stubborn lady and I get that from her huh so she I didn't I didn't know she was sick until she was very very second till she was already close to passing yeah yeah yeah and so when you're then the one who's sick and you're watching your children watch you is your concern about how your children would deal with it if you passed away or or you sort of stuck in that moment of losing your own mom I really didn't think about my mom that much to be honest with you I I just saw the look on my husband and my kids faces and knew how scared they were that they were gonna lose me and that's really where my focus was that's kind of what got me up every day and fought fighting so this interesting the fact is that if you go back on tour that connection gets disrupted a little bit yeah yeah look at that there was a little bit of a nervous smile there any eyes tell me about that well things are never gonna be the same mm-hmm and a part of me knows that gets it things were forever changed and that's not necessarily bad but if I could get some semblance of my life back I think it would create sort of a comfort I don't know a comfort level that that has been gone for the last couple of years I'm almost hearing that you want some normalcy some pattern to sort of bring the previous types of interactions back to the forefront rather than having them still look at you like are you okay - yeah is that happening a lot where they're like mom are you okay because they were you were so sick yeah they're like mom let me get that actually let me get it yeah you know what is there any advantage from your perspective to your children having seen you through this illness any advantage yes for them yes I think that they see that bad things can happen and our family's strong and our family is just supportive and loving and that if you have that foundation you know you'll get through it mm-hmm did you sense some like unconditional love and oh gosh yeah yeah absolutely so you because you've consistently described these really great kids is what I'm getting at so I'm trying to understand that connection that you're drawing in your heart and mind between potentially letting go of their old version of mom and designing a new one I'm hearing you know that they unconditionally love and accept you but I'm afraid of what will happen with them if I don't go back to the standard person I am yeah so what is that you can grew it you get it what is that anything grew and see about oh I don't know it's just change you know they've been through so much change to tell time I was sick it's just you know you always want to protect your kids and keep them safe and even though they're they're grown-ups but it's just that that change you know have you had conversations with any of your kids about your feelings about the changing and all that's changing and their experience of you being sick no why not I don't know how to I don't know how to bring it up I feel really weird you know what do I just at dinner so you guys you know let's talk about when I was really sick so I I just don't know I don't know how to do it can i push again can I have your permission to push again okay seems to me that you hold a lot in your own head almost like you're having conversations with all of these people about all of these things but just in here because the unknown is so worrisome to you that you just don't engage you don't play the game right you don't get out there and allow them to have their part in their relationship because you're making the decision about what conversation they can manage and can't what amount of change they can manage and can't and yet I hear you telling me they're great kids they've all gone through college they're all living independently you've got a couple that are starting families and they have seen really hard times they have potentially faced the loss of their mom why can't they have these conversations I mean it just feels really uncomfortable and I don't know exactly I mean you know maybe I just need to say look we need to have a family meeting and just all sit down and go to the beach for a day and just talk about all the things does that feel like wow at least if I did it all together in one fell swoop this conversation would be over with and that goodbye I don't know if it would be over that yeah but it would I think it'd be nice for us all to be together to know that you know somebody says something it's it's okay you know you're not playing the telephone game we were one call that's a nail game yeah yeah when you imagine doing something like that inviting your kids off to the beach and having some family time and then bringing up this sort of sad and scary and interesting topic what happens for you hmm I don't know in some ways that sounds kind of great hmm what ways helm great well we could all be together we'll be at the beach is beautiful you know we can all make food together hang out together there'll be no pressure of everyday life sort of getting in the way no phone calls no emails get away from the standard ways that life imposes yeah yeah yeah do you think you'd have to have a conversation and authentic and honest conversation with your husband before this family you haven't yeah I would what would that be like I have to tell him my concerns I have to ask him hard questions and I have to be ready for whatever he says let's imagine that what he has to say you don't want to hear don't believe me I've already imagined that 100 that I I know that that's why you stay stuck in your head right it's sort of why you're here is let's get it out of your head sometimes just sharing it with another person allows you to really a own it and be hear the things that probably aren't true okay so tell me what you think that conversations gonna go like between you and your husband I'm my biggest concern is that if I say honey I just I don't think I want to tour anymore after this one I think you know I've worked so hard to get ready for this one like you know what might as well do it but but I think we need to make some different plans for the future my concern is that he's gonna say absolutely yes whatever you need but that that he might not feel like he can be honest with me because he needs to support me you know what I mean so in essence you're talking about a really nice guy who's going to give up the dreams he's had for your family because you've just come off of an illness he wants to be the concerned and caring husband is he really that inauthentic no but I think there's absolutely an element of wanting to make me feel safe and and secure you know and and I he does you know he is the kind of person that kind of will give up of himself mm-hmm you know he's been the caregiver and the nurturer and your family all his role so my worry is that he he might do that in an effort to take care of me instead of just saying what he feels to take care of himself and if he didn't if he actually was honest with you and said I'm a little nervous too I am going to be supportive of you but I'm also concerned that this dynamic that we have of having excitement about seeing each other is going to be gone and you're right this whole years I guess would be more than a year now almost two years of your treatment has been super hard and I'm I was desperately looking forward to you leaving and getting back into that old dynamic what would happen for you he said something like that I don't know I really don't I mean I I think I I would be glad to know the truth if that was what was true for him you know it's just the fear of it is bigger than actually probably doing it you know what I mean I sort of know what you mean so in this case I want to know what the actual doing it part means for you it's just gonna I'm afraid that that if he says that that our marriage could get into trouble I thought you were gonna say something else this is super interesting I thought you were gonna say that if in fact he really said that you would just buck up and go back on tour permanently well ultimately that's probably what I would do so that was a fair sort of adjustment I mean I think I think that fear would get there and then I you know I'd be really worried about my marriage and then I think if I know myself I would just go like okay well let's just not rock this I don't want to mess with this okay so let me pull the pieces together okay I'm sorry for the convoluted way I'm in which I'm gonna do this okay we've just had early in this conversation this important dialogue about how meaningful it would be for you to find yourself yes after this very significant what we would call a non normative life invent you almost died the meaningfulness about knowing who you are and what you want and the recognition that Wow that can change right in the middle of a life they can change and that seems both scary and absolutely valuable you have to do that now something is different in your life and what you just told me is if your husband told you the truth you'd hide that away again mm-hmm and tell him what he needed to hear and do what you need it to do do you really believe you could stuff that part of yourself away I have to think about that it's pretty big yes yeah that's really big I have to think about that from the person sitting back here from the counselor's chair you know I only work with this person I respect your family they certainly have been there for you I've never met them but I respect the way you talk about them and I believe how you talk about them but you're the person in the chair and as a clinician I go oh my gosh how she gonna live the rest of her life not being true not just to who she is but the entirety of her life experience and I think wow that would be the saddest day is the day that you realize that despite this significant lesson in your life you had to go back to doing everything you previously did as though nothing had changed I hear you I hear what you're saying that seems really sad it does when you say it like that I feel like maybe this is something I need to yeah take and take you should take the time to do that right nothing is going to happen if you don't rush out to have these conversations right away but just being able to take the time to engage here it feels like it gives you an alternative like someplace to truly talk about what it is you want what you believe what you value that's very true and I want you to know that there's not a right answer if you said to me this is what's best for the entirety of my life and I'm going back on tour that's just gonna be the way it is my heart would be for you yeah not against I know you know I just want to help you focus on what it is that is most important to you I get it and I guess I have to do a lot more thinking you're welcome to it make sure you get enough sleep oh right yeah all right it's gonna exhaust you yeah do all of us thinking you know maybe what I need to do is get is to keep a diary when I was a kid maybe something like that you know so I can just jot these things down when they pop into my hand yeah yeah it's a fabulous idea I love that you came up with that all on I just said that when I was a kid I had win in it and I kind of really I forgot all about that but I it was really kind of cool to have that that little relationship with myself yes you know yeah especially when you're not sure like you're testing the waters and you're not quite sure you fully believe that part of yourself yet yeah that self is strong enough to really advocate yeah that that journal sounds like a live thing because I won today awesome that's phenomenal I love it when clients come their own homework I don't feel like an ogre of signing : no I think this is really good and I think I think it's a lot easier for me to sort of speak to a journal before I have these kinds of conversations with my family I love the or the organic way in which you've come up with this work if you choose to share it with me in next sessions I'm very open to that and if you think you still need to keep it private like it's working for you to keep it private then feel free to do that as well okay we'll play it by your okay thanks for coming today yeah thank you thank you so much yeah I'll see you next week okay
