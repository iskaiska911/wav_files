hi good to see you again hi can i uh take a look at your scores sure so while i'm looking at these just tell me in your own words how you've been feeling this week well i would say i think a little bit better i don't know if i know exactly why but i feel a little bit better like when i woke up in the morning i was able to get up more more easily and i think that when i was you know just like reading the paper even the sports section i would i i felt like i was able to concentrate a little better oh that's wonderful i'm really glad to hear that and it looks like you're sleeping better too well i um i think that what i meant by that was um mostly that i didn't oversleep okay because i i had been spending a lot of time in in bed and i didn't get up i mean i would say i got up at seven but i didn't really get up at seven oh that's great that's great and you're looks like your concentration things like reading the newspaper you said yeah that's a little better too yeah yeah oh i'm really glad so um you said you don't have any idea as to why you're feeling better maybe that's not entirely fair maybe it's because of the the things that that we're doing here that are helping oh that's great and we'll we'll get to those things in just a minute but let's set the agenda so what would be your goal for today's session well um i guess to to start thinking about working on the things that that make it difficult for me to do things to get better like we talked about doing you know going out and and doing things and and last time we talked about what i would like things to be like by labor day um so what's something that uh you would like to be able to do but you've been having trouble doing with something either going out or in the apartment well it's it's kind of like the evenings are really hard for me because even if i go out and do something then at the end of the day i go back and i'm there by myself and and then i'm just sort of there with my thoughts yeah good okay so we'll try to get to evenings anything else any other goals you have i would say that that's probably the uh the main thing well you know i i should do something about my apartment i don't keep after that like like i should and so maybe um you want to get your apartment in better order yeah but that seems like such a big job i i don't know where to start yeah well maybe we could figure out together where to start okay well that sounds good and all right also so we're setting the agenda i'd also like to talk a little bit more about these depressing thoughts that you've been having and talking some more about credit if that's okay all right you know what i'd like to do next is just to turn to the notes from actually from the evaluation and then the notes from last session okay so if it's all right i'll just read this and i'd like you to tell me what you think about this now when i start to feel more depressed you find it yeah um remind myself that the therapy plan makes sense does it still make sense to you yes it does with judith's help i'll be working toward goals every week step by step i'll learn how to evaluate my thinking which might be a hundred percent true or zero percent true or some place in the middle what do you think about that well i think this the the idea of working toward goals every week is is a good idea and and i think that you're helping me to figure out what those things are is is good if i evaluate my thinking which may be a hundred percent or not or somewhere in the middle um you know we really haven't done that yet help you evaluate your thinking we've just been identifying your thinking but does it make sense to you that you might still be seeing the world through black glasses mostly yeah that the thoughts might not all the thoughts are a hundred percent true i think most of my my my thoughts are but when i go out and do things then i feel better when i'm doing that i don't have as many black thoughts then yeah so it sounds like this next part is true then the way i'll feel better is by making small changes in my thinking and behavior every day yeah excellent and we also talked about at the evaluation we know we didn't we covered it just a little bit last session so i want to talk about it more this session give myself credit for doing things on the action plan for doing anything else that helps me get over the depression and for anything that's even a little bit difficult but i do it anyway were you any better at giving yourself credit this week i i think so i mean last week i hadn't really done that much that i really felt that i deserved any credit but i i tried to push myself this week and do the things we talked about so i yeah i i was better because i was able to recognize i was pushing myself and doing it well i think in a few minutes maybe we'll talk about keeping a credit list so we'll get to that too so again what was the best part of this past week or when did you feel the best when were you at your best well all of the things i mean just going out for a walk is better than sitting on the couch but you know i i went went out with my grandson again and that was good ethan again ethan yeah what'd you do with him um well we just went out and got ice cream uh again vanilla well i tried a different flavor did you what'd you try um it was like it was a chocolate swirl thing uh-huh so it was different which do you like better the vanilla the week before right about the same i like trying something new oh that's good good for you um so you're at your best when you took ethan for ice cream again yeah yeah and again what was good about taking him for ice cream i i think it's it's just fun to to be with him and just talk about stuff and to feel kind of like a normal person yeah so you felt less depressed when you're out with him yeah yeah that's good so does that imply that actually you might be able to do things that can help you feel better i guess so was it easy to go out with him or was it still hard it was easier than the first time it was a lot easier than the first time i mean i still have some questions but it was a lot easier you know if it was easier it makes me think that your thinking must have been different do you know what you were thinking as you were so you're getting ready to go out with him what were you thinking i was thinking well last time went pretty good so no reason to think that this time won't be good too yeah so i was just sort of more able to look forward to it as i was as i was going to do it so this time you were making a positive prediction and your mood was better yeah and it made it easier to go out yeah that's great okay um i want to just get back to the therapy notes from last week too so were you able to read these every day i did yeah i would rather be able to pull any other times during the day i'm not sure we even um asked you to do that i just sort of like after i got up in the morning and took a shower and stuff i just sort of you would read this right right okay so tell me what you think of this when i criticize myself remember i'm only looking at part of the scene and it's through black glasses judy says it's not my fault it's happening because i have depression i think that there's some truth to that do you think you're accepting this fact more that you do have a real illness last week i think it was a hard thing to even think about well i think that was the first time that i really thought about it in that way and when you went down and read the list of things to me i mean i could say yeah that's that's me that's you so so i think that you know it's it's in a book it must mean something yeah so are you thinking now that um your condition is more like pneumonia something that happens that has these really negative symptoms makes everything harder good that's good and then we talked about last week about how your thinking influences how you feel and what you do we able to catch any of those automatic thoughts this week i don't think i even called them automatic you're just your depressed thoughts my thoughts yeah um did you catch any this week yeah when um i guess the worst ones like what i said that sitting on the couch was is is hard so when i was sitting there you know there would be times when i i was thinking that you know i'm not going to get better and when you had that thought how did that make you feel bad and really able to remind yourself at all that just because you think something doesn't necessarily mean it's true yeah i i did um and i can't say i believe that 100 but i believe it more okay in the beginning that's good and and and then probably in my weaker moments i said you know this this isn't going to work meaning this therapy his therapy yeah you know so i went out and had ice cream with my grandson well i ought to be doing that anyway and i went for a walk why i'd be doing something really self-critical yeah yeah all right can we talk um yeah i think i'll come back to the rest of the homework in a few minutes let's let's talk about a credit list if that's all right it seems to me that you've lost a lot of confidence in yourself losing my job really really hurt yeah it seems to me you've lost confidence in a lot of ways so you've lost confidence about your ability to work you're afraid that even if you got a job you wouldn't do it very well seems like you've lost confidence in your ability to keep your apartment in order lost confidence in how other people might view you it makes it harder to get together with friends you think i'm right about this yeah well and we haven't even talked much about my ex-wife you know about the fact that the the marriage failed you know that's yeah that's pretty bad it's not surprising that you've lost confidence in yourself because that's what depression really does it really makes you lose confidence and it would be really really important for you to recognize that you are taking steps to take control of your life again and so that's why i'd like you to keep a credit list in writing if you can in fact let's see i think did i bring this with me no i didn't so you could just keep it on any kind of piece of paper or you could keep this credit list on a three by five card that you keep in your pocket or you could keep a list on your phone and this is just like my saying good job to myself yeah exactly exactly and this is when i want you to do it we talked a little bit about this at the evaluation whenever you do anything that's even a little bit difficult but you do it anyway you deserve credit for that okay should i write that down on your action plan for you yeah now if you had pneumonia and yet you were able to get yourself out of bed you were able to go to the supermarket you were able to put in a load of laundry would you think you deserve credit for it yeah yeah yeah only because even though i think i'm supposed to do them i haven't done them for a long time exactly that's exactly right the depression has been so severe it's been so hard for you to do these things and it sounds to me as if you've done some things this week that were even a little bit difficult but you did them anyway is that right yeah going for the walks and and i walked by the church one day too oh that's great all right so we can start your credit list right now should i give you a piece of paper i can write it down here okay i've got it here so you said this week you walked by the church it was easier to take your son out for ice cream was it easy not easy but okay so it was even a little bit difficult easier then it goes on the list took ethan out for ice cream what did you even do today that was a little bit difficult but you did it anyway well yeah i i don't know that this was even on on the list but when i when i after i got up and and took my shower this morning i i straightened up a couple things in the apartment oh that's great was that even a little bit difficult oh it's really hard okay so write that on me i missed i didn't make a big dent in everything that needs to be done and that's we have that on our agenda to talk more about today but you did some things around the apartment and we hadn't even talked about you doing that i just moved them around a little bit okay kind of make it a clearer path to walk through was it good that you did that it would have been better if you hadn't done it it was a good idea good you did it so it absolutely belongs on the list how about getting out of bed was that easy today it was a lot easier well i'm so i wake up and lots of times i just stay in bed but what i've been trying to do is push myself to actually get out of bed when i wake up at seven so pushed myself and got up all right so can you write down got out of bed you know a lot of people say well why do i deserve credit for getting out of bed it's just what i should do yeah is that something you were thinking oh yeah okay so i have to tell you that every morning when i get out of bed i give myself credit because i would much rather you know turn off the alarm go back to sleep but i don't when i say well it's good you got up and i'm not even depressed okay so abe once you're over the depression it'll be your choice as to whether you give yourself credit for getting out of bed or not but while it's still even a little bit difficult it's really important okay can you see how giving yourself credit for these things might help you build up your confidence show you that you are able to do things that are difficult i wasn't thinking about it that way but i mean i just kind of feel better thinking about it yeah that i'm doing those things but i have to somehow remind myself that it has to do with building confidence yeah that's good should i write that on your action plan too yeah uh so when i do anything that's even a little bit difficult give myself credit and how should i phrase it this will build my confidence yeah this will build my confidence anything else you did today that was even a little bit difficult um no i i thought about doing something but i didn't do it so how about coming to therapy today was that even a little bit difficult yeah yeah okay that goes on your list too so came to therapy so we have a bunch of things that you did just even today that you deserve credit for now if you don't give yourself credit for those things what happens then i just think about it the same way i always did that i ought to be doing that stuff anyway yeah and so you feel like guilty you feel bad feel bad guilty lazy right instead of wow these things are hard because i'm depressed so of course you deserve credit for doing right yeah do you think you could keep a list like this every day yeah maybe maybe it would help if i would do this while i'm sitting on the couch at nighttime oh that's a great idea that's when i have trouble yeah okay so keep lists do at night now the only problem with only doing it at night is that if you're like most people you're likely to forget 90 of what you actually did yeah but i'm wondering i see you're wearing the rubber band yeah right it sounds like did that work to have you ask yourself what was going through your mind yeah when i had one when i was sitting that's how i realized that that the evenings were difficult because i was kind of i was sitting there and having a hard time and normally you know i just go get a beer and and not think about it but because of this then i thought about it then i knew what the thoughts were so i wonder if you could use the rubber band to remind you not only to look for your depressing thoughts which might or might not be true but to also ask yourself what have i done in the last hour or two hours or something like that that i deserve credit for yeah so using the rubber band as a reminder okay so back to what you got done this past week uh didn't we able to take a look at the goal list yeah right here do you have any changes on that no i still i mean visiting family is still really important um you know still the idea about the job like i i really want well i looked at it i really want one but i'm afraid i'll mess it up still yeah so if we have time maybe we'll get back to that and the goal this was one of the things i said i thought about but i didn't do i thought about you know calling calling up one of my friends but i didn't well i think we had we had agreed that that might be too hard for you so that i don't think that was even part of your action plan let me just see what was walking by the church you said you did that um did you uh visit the kids other than taking ethan i went to see ethan the the other kids were there so i you know spent a few minutes playing with them that's great uh you were going to go out to the supermarket were you able to do that i did yeah i got it's just good to have some some vegetables and and stuff in the house instead of just eating everything out of a can and you were supposed to try to get out of the house at least four times this week were you able to yeah i did i mean i mean if i get to count going out with ethan as one of those times then was it even more than four well that i walked by the church one day i did maybe five days oh excellent so what would you like to do this week in terms of getting out of the house i'm afraid to set the bar too high so maybe five times how about four to six times how does that sound i should be able should i write that on your action plan yeah okay i should be able to do that and out of house four to six times so you were able to get out of the house what was good about getting out of the house what did it show you well one that i can do things that up to this point i just thought i couldn't do right i'm writing that down i can do things i thought i couldn't do when i do them i feel good about it yeah when i do them i feel good about them so does this imply that maybe you can start to take more control over your mood maybe it does so what should i write down about that well i think it's still more in the form of a question in my head does this mean that so it's kind of like a how about a maybe this means yeah is that about right yeah maybe it means that this means what i can do that there are things i can do that i can take control yep exactly there are things i can do to take control i want to talk just a little bit more about depressing thoughts and then maybe we can talk about getting your apartment in order or would you rather talk about evenings if we only have time to get to one of those which would you like to get to evenings evenings okay is there a problem yeah okay we'll do that so you were able to catch some of these depressed thoughts this week yeah right yeah and so what do you think of this idea that the way that you feel say for example as you're taking a walk or as you're with ethan the way that you feel is going to depend at least in great part as to what's going through your mind well i think i think there's truth to that yeah and for example so when you thought uh i'll never get better what effect did that have on your mood just make me depressed maybe you want to give up exactly and if you have that thought again i'll never get better how would you like to answer that thought i guess the first thing is it's it's that's not a sure thing that i'll never get better anymore that's excellent that's not a sure thing um what makes you think that it might not be true because when i do stuff i feel better exactly so you've really started to prove that to your to yourself then so i've started to prove this to myself and what was the other thought um this isn't this isn't going to work yeah therapy isn't going to work and what would you like to remind yourself about that well i i don't want to jinx it but it seems like a little bit it already is so it seems a little bit that it already is that's good all right i got that on your action plan for you okay now we call these kinds of thoughts these thoughts that just seem to pop up into your mind we call them automatic thoughts and it's not your fault that you're having them the reason that you're having these really negative automatic thoughts is because you're depressed so we've been talking about that okay and so this week you're going to use the rubber band again to try to keep on identifying those thoughts yeah and to keep on reminding yourself that just because you think them doesn't necessarily mean that it's true and here i've written down uh answers to a couple of the automatic thoughts you had this past week that you might have this coming week okay if i think i'll never get better remind myself that's not a sure thing i've started to prove this to myself this isn't going to work if i think that remind myself it seems a little bit that it already is i think that might help now before we get to evenings or maybe it has something to do with the evenings you said earlier today that being with the family is really important to you i wonder if there's something that you could do in the evenings you know either being with your family or talking to them on the phone what would you what would you like to be able to do if you weren't depressed what would you do well i'd like to go over but i don't i don't want to invite myself but i could call them and talk to them on the phone and oftentimes when i call they invite me over okay so you're going to talk on the phone to whom my my son and my daughter great i could give them a call so you have a you have some thought that gets in the way of your saying hey it's convenient for me to come over i don't i don't want to impose so the thought is if i invite myself be imposing on them yeah is that right i'll be imposing on them if we can take a moment here to try to figure out whether that thought is a hundred percent true or zero percent true or someplace in the middle i don't know it might be 100 true but what makes you think that they'll see it as an imposition i don't i don't know if they will i just think of it i just think of myself that way have you before you got depressed did you ever invite yourself over yeah can i come over and spend some time with with the kids and did they seem to have a negative attitude about you doing that no not at all they always seemed happy to have me come over i see and were there any times when you um invited yourself over where they said gee today isn't a really good time they didn't say well they yeah they would just instead of saying it's not a good time they'd say something like tomorrow would be better you know because we've got something scheduled something scheduled right so if i could summarize what you just said in the past when you've uh invited yourself over they've been glad to see you and it sounds like they've been honest if it would be an imposition on them yeah so have they changed in some way do you think that they wouldn't want you to come over now no i think it's just i've changed my thinking the way i think about my when i get into that spiral you know i start thinking that stuff and then i guess it's stuff i just make up so if um i wonder if another way of looking at this is that maybe they would do exactly what they've done in the past which is either to welcome you or to reschedule i think that's possible yeah i i think so yeah yeah and if the worst happens and they say gee sorry but we're really busy now then how could you cope with that i think i called the other one that's a great idea right so but that's only the worst that could happen what's the best that could happen if you called one of them they'd say sure we'd love to have you over when would you like to come yeah that sounds pretty good what do you think is the most realistic outcome say they'd probably say something like yeah that'd be great we'd be happy to have you over you know thursday night would be a good time can you come over then so the most realistic is that they'd be really glad that you called i think so and they'd they'd set a date with you they were always good in the past about those kinds of things it's just like yeah just since i started going downhill it was more like me not calling them not not them saying they didn't want to see me right so how do you want to answer this thought if i invite myself i'll be imposing on them well in the past they've always been happy to hear from me yeah so in the past they were always happy to hear from me that's good so would you like to set yourself an action plan item about this i should call one of them anyway if not those what do you think one or both how about one with the other one being optional that sounds good okay so you're going to call your son or the dog which one's going to be optional my daughter will be optional okay so do you think it might be a good idea for you to call them and try to go over one evening since evenings are so tough for you yeah yeah that would be really good if i could do that yeah and then optionally you'd call the other one and see if you could go over one evening what else would you like to be able to do in the evenings well you know the kid the grandkids they have different kinds of activities going on i could you know i i could go to something i could go to a game or a concert you know until you know this is sort of the end of the school year for them and they've got different kinds of things going on at school that i get sounds great that's great and on the evenings when you stay in your apartment what would you like to be doing i know what i should do but i should do something well even if i could read the paper and concentrate on it that would be an improvement okay so another thing is you might read the newspaper read the entire sports section that would be an improvement okay i used to like politics but that's getting harder so i don't i don't know if i want to do that now i think we should make the entire sports session sports section um optional but at least you'd read part of it is that all right yeah yeah and you mentioned uh getting your apartment in better order is there something you'd like to do during the day or the evening about that i should probably clean up the kitchen you know i just get the dirty stuff out of the sink and put it away that would so cleaning the kitchen but not the whole kitchen right you just said the whole kitchen clean the sink okay that sounds good which would be by itself a big improvement yeah so how likely are you to clean the sink part of it for sure um do you want to maybe set a time limit on it like clean the sink for 10 minutes and then you can stop that would be good okay that way i could do that and yeah be okay with putting the ten minutes in is there something else you'd like to do this week something that you know around the apartment that if you did it you could say okay this shows i'm starting to take control starting to take control of the apartment like doing the some of the dishes what else would make a difference to you nice probably clean the bathroom oh that sounds like a big job well maybe just the sink okay clean the bathroom sink is this enough or should we give you one more time starting to sound like a lot all right so let me go through if this is okay the action plan that we have so far and then let's cross some things off or make some things easier all right so when you do uh anything that's even a little bit difficult you're going to give yourself credit okay and you're going to write it on a piece of paper you've already started my rubber band as a reminder to do that yeah i'm going to put down rubber band right and we wrote down that the reason to do this is that it will build your confidence yeah and this is something that you're going to do at night but you're going to keep the rubber band and at least try to keep track of these things during the day also okay get out of the house four to six times how does that sound yeah i can do that okay um how much do you agree with this idea i can do things i thought i couldn't do how true do you think that is true well little things anyway that's true that's true i mean i've already done that so i'm writing it true next to that um when i do them i feel good about them yeah i agree with that that's true uh maybe this means there are things i can do to take control 50 percent i believe maybe we'll come back to that if we have time if i think i'll never get better remind myself that it's not that not getting better is not a sure thing i've started to prove this to myself i've started doing things and when i do those things i feel better so that's kind of proof that doing things could help and when you think this isn't going to work remind myself it seems a little bit that it already is yeah i believe that that's true yeah because because i do feel better now could you read these therapy notes um every morning keep them by the coffee maker like the other ones could you read the other notes too the ones from last week and the ones from the week before yeah okay so i'll write that here read all the therapy notes i think they probably are all still relevant to you in the morning and i do think it would help to read them later on in the day would you be willing to try to do that yeah i'm just trying to think when would be the time to do it i mean i've said i'd do a couple things in the evenings on the couch and i'm i'm afraid to overload the evening to have too many things on the list at the end of the day so how long do you think it will take you to read the notes five five minutes no i don't think so i think it'll probably take a minute and a half if we had time i'd have you right read them right now and we could time you but that's fine if you'd like to read in the afternoon that's fine what would you think about setting a timer on your phone that's what i do all right i think maybe when i when i eat my dinner that would be oh okay great all right so how are you going to remind yourself do you want to uh a note um in the kitchen make this a multi-purpose rubber band okay so when you notice the rubber band at dinner you'll save read the notes okay so notice the rubber band to remind you okay it helps me to write it down too good i'm going to give you a copy of this too so you'll have two copies um talk on the oh so i want to make sure that these things don't sound overwhelming talk on the phone to your son and daughter to your son and then talking to your daughter's option uh i'll call him i'll call him and and uh invite yourself over maybe make that optional yep let's do that i'll call them but inviting self over is optional and i did put a note on here in the past they were always happy to hear from me that's true so maybe that'll help okay and then in the uh evenings we said if you could just draw a line from that over to making the phone call so that i that links up there that's good in the evenings we talked about trying to go to a game or a concert something that your grandchildren are involved in or even during the day because they have things during the day at school so day or evening you know things in the late afternoon so do you want to keep that on or you want to make that optional i'd like to do that okay in the evening read the newspaper if you can even the entire sports section you want to keep that on yeah okay and then i think these things were for the day but i'm not sure one was clean the kitchen sink for 10 minutes now i think that was in the evening that i oh okay i wanted to do that because that would give me something to do okay instead of just sitting on the couch got it so how likely are you to do that one evening one evening for 10 minutes i'll do that and cleaning the bathroom sink less so optional yeah okay so this is um there's a lot on the sheet but most of it is just reading things to yourself so the stuff we actually have you doing is giving yourself credit getting out of the house four to six times reading your therapy notes talking on the phone to your son going to a game or to a concert or something with your grandchildren some kind of school activity okay reading the newspaper at least once and then cleaning the kitchen sink how hard will it be to give yourself credit i think i can do that and remind me what the point is of giving yourself credit well i i recognize then that i'm doing something even though i have depression yeah and that by doing these things it gives me a way to take control over that and then what happens to your confidence in yourself better it gets better right so you think you can give yourself credit do you think you can get out of the house four to six times um do you think it's gonna be easier this week to get out of the house at least four times yeah i like doing that okay so it sounds like that uh reading the therapy notes how hard will that be that won't be hard okay talking to your son on the phone how hard will that be after i call him it'll be fine he'll be happy to hear from me it's just dialing the number that's going to be the hard part yeah and so is there something you want to remind yourself of why do something that's hard why call yourself they've always been happy to hear from me before yeah any other reasons to call your son family connections just a bunch of people i think your son might feel good if you call him probably be happy to hear from me yeah so it would help you and it would probably make your son feel good when you realize that does it make it harder to do or easier to do easier because i think they're worried about me and if they hear from me they'll they'll feel better exactly and how hard will it be to read the newspaper well that shouldn't be hard as long as i'm i've as long as i can concentrate on it um going to an at least one event with your uh that your grandchildren are involved with like i can do that it's just maybe a scheduling thing about whether or not i i mean i i don't have any idea what i just know that towards the end of the school year they do stuff yeah so um what maybe we'll just put if it works out that's good cleaning the sink for 10 minutes how hard is that going to be i think making it for 10 minutes makes it easier if i think about i have to clean up the sink that would be really hard but 10 minutes i can do that that's good and reading all your therapy notes not just this week but from last week and a week before i think you can do that i can do that over dinner right from there well abe i think you've got a great action plan here even if you could only do half of it it would be so much better than you were doing three weeks ago wouldn't it it's a lot more yeah and i think if you're able to not only do it but give yourself credit my guess is you're pretty soon gonna really notice this you know small changes in your mood i notice the change in my mood when i'm doing stuff yeah well it's great that you can see that so what do you think of today's session it i mean it it's good and you know i start thinking well maybe maybe this will work because um these are all things that i i want to do yeah but it's been really hard because of those black glasses i think do you think that those thoughts have really gotten in the way yeah i want to do them and i think that if i do do them i think that things will go better i think so too now of course you're going to have your ups and downs this week yeah right so there are probably going to be times when you're more depressed but when you when you are feeling more depressed you know the best thing to do is just to get up off the couch anything that you do other than sitting on the couch thinking depressing thoughts is better than that anything that you do and the whole thing with depression is depression saps motivation it makes you just want to sit on the couch and so what's really important is not to do what you feel like doing when you're depressed because all you feel like doing is sitting on the couch but what's really important to do is the things that will help you take better control so not what you feel like doing but the things that will help you feel more in control should i write that down too can i i've got it you got it okay yeah yeah i'll put it here so i'll know it from my notes too so not what you feel like doing but what will help you feel in control that's good so was there anything i said today that bothered you or you thought i got wrong it was real helpful and how about when you come in next time anything you want to do differently no i think that if we just keep doing this yeah i'm hoping this works oh i think it's going to work i really do uh see you next time next week same time great okay
