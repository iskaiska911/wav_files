okay thank you for taking the time to meet with me i really needed somebody to bounce some ideas off of um i've just been feeling lately like i'm kind of bored in my job and um i feel really underutilized with with the skills that i have i feel like i could bring a lot more to the table so it sounds like your your goal here is that you want to feel more challenged yes and maybe like your strengths and skills are more fully utilized yes okay yeah so what's happening currently that might be getting in the way of that well i feel like a lot of the responsibilities that i have in my job right now i've i mastered a long time ago and i don't have a whole lot of room in my schedule to do much more than that yet i would like to try to find some room in my schedule to to do some more challenging things so um it sounds like looking at some supporter resources from your manager or within the company to see who might be able to be cross-trained or take some of the more administrative or right right lower skills tasks off your desk okay yeah so have you thought about how you might go about accomplishing that i do need to find ways to take on bigger responsibilities maybe stretch myself a little bit take on some projects that are more challenging more interesting to me um and that help me grow and feel like i'm contributing at a higher level so i need to really be proactive about that i think so it sounds like a conversation with your manager around shifting some of the tasks and also more proactively looking for opportunities right for you great way to say it to do some more challenging work those sound like some good options or good places to start yeah okay so what could be your next step i'm currently having regular one-on-ones with my manager so i just need to make sure that i am bringing that up on a regular basis and we kind of come up with a plan and we stay on track and we have deadlines and goals for those um for each of those steps and so that's kind of my plan well that sounds like a good place to start yeah um and if you want me to follow up and check in on you i'm happy to do so or if you want to come talk to me and let me know how things are going i'm here to support you
