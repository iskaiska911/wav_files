 so Amanda have you been going since our last session well I haven't really been enjoying working with my new manager that's bad news in it yeah man what what's happening well he all we have meetings on a regular basis but he does actually give me any direction what I'm supposed to be doing I think he just expects that I can just work out what him you know what Hicks what he wants he just puts ideas out there I don't I don't know what to do with them so he sort of feeling overwhelmed and you want him to give you a little bit more guide and absolutely that's his job so it sounds like you're not used to being managed this way no no my last my last manager was amazing so we would have regular meetings even like often on a daily basis I could go in there with my daily work plan we could talk through what I needed to do all of the steps work that I needed to take she was right there at the end of the her office but you know at the end of the emails she replied to my emails almost instantaneously and so we had his bounce ideas back and forth so you're finding that your new manager has a really different sort of style when he leads me to my own devices and what are you wanting from him instead well I want to be able to speak to him whenever I need to speak to him I'm often like all throughout the day I've things that I need to ask and I just can't get a foot in the door so what happens when you do try to go and see him ah well he's not really keen he said he said kind of there's an expectation that I should just be getting on with her like that you know I should be able to just roll with it and give him updates rather than actually sit down and talk about what it is that I'm going to be doing hmm so you're really feeling like there's a gap in terms of the sort of level of guidance that he's giving to you and what your wanting is for him to go through things in a little bit more detail with you absolutely it's more top level you mentioned earlier that you are meeting with him but that that's not working so just talk me through a little bit about how often you do imagined and what sort of things are happening in those meetings when you do manage to pin him down well it's well it's probably once or twice a week um we sit down here talks to me about what are the key projects that I'm delivering on he just seeks an update he sort of says are there any other any concerns or risks that he needs to be aware of really just it's more of us it's more of a status update and is there a big problem that he needs to step in so if we would have sort of try and get into his head what do you think he's expecting from you that's a good question um he's I guess it's just expected that I know what I'm doing and then I can that I'm I'm implementing without needing to have to speak through the detail with him mm-hmm well that's look at that realistically do you know what you're doing yes what I like to sound bored with people my ideas for how I'm going to approach a key deliverable or a task now we need to really look at what you're doing with your manager and how you think he wants you to be communicating because I think we're starting to get a bit of an issue there aren't we around how that process of conversation is going in your meetings yes I'm getting frustrated and it's impacting on my workday and and my motivation to come to work so let's imagine that you woke up tomorrow and that situation had changed you'd found the magic formula that was going to make that relationship work what do you think you'd be doing differently with your manager well I think I would be I would be easier to work with I think I think I'm at the moment I'm probably guarded I'm not sharing information because I'm kind of holding back I guess in a way because I'm not feeling supported I think it's the the magic formula version I think would be where he would give me some more guidance as to how he wanted me to approach a key piece of work um I get I guess I'm sorry I get what you're saying here I understand that he had trusts me to do the delivery but perhaps I need to be more front about seeking some advice on on some pieces of my work okay so let's imagine that you were doing that in a way that would work for him what's he going to expect from you coming in to see him around that I guess what he's expecting from me is someone that really owns their responsibilities and recognizes that he is time poor so ideally what do you think he would see as being the ideal timeframe for one of these meetings oh my goodness um well I know he's got several teams or several people that reporting to him so he he wouldn't he wouldn't be able to spend that as much time I guess as I want with every single one of his direct reports so I guess he probably only needs to see me everything going well once a week even for half an hour for that update so how we going to organize that how are you going to get all of this done once a week in a half-hour format oh gosh so I think I need to be on top of the perhaps I probably need to prioritize what I'm going to ask him what I need his input on instead of going there with everything so how many points do you think you should have ideally in one meeting oh gosh five probably three mm-hmm okay so if we said the top three priorities that you typically need to get through what would that be I'll probably say this is where we're up to this is an issue and this is where I just need to get some input from you or feedback on how to move something forward let's imagine how he would respond to that I think he would love that I think he gets frustrated with me that I'm actually always trying to get that information from him and I think that would be a real shift in our in our relationship so I think that that would be hugely beneficial and he would see that the meetings that would probably be more productive on a scale of one to ten how effective do you think this solution is going to be with one thing not effective at all and 10 being fabulous oh gosh I think this has a potential to be a 10 considering right now I've been sitting at a1 before I came to see you so I think this is gay I've you've definitely given me some clarity about what what my needs and wants on and how I could best sort of get those so yeah I feel good about this because I hadn't thought about it from Ben's perspective before and I hadn't actually even really thought about I had definitely had thought about speaking to Jane and as a mentor and I think she'd be a fabulous mentor it sounds as though now you're realizing that maybe Ben's giving you an opportunity to work at that much more strategic level and I'm really pleased to hear that you starting to thinking too it being possible for you I think
