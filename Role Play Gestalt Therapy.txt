all right Howie Sandra well we have about half an hour together to sign and how are you feeling right now with your awareness Eve is a bit of a kind of situation is different last time um no I'm still feeling the same I just yeah ah just just a little frustrated at the moment that's all what is the frustration like for you it's just a a tight feeling that I have I just um yeah it's very it's difficult to put into words but just it just doesn't feel okay good so let's shift it to your body where in your body you feel this tight feeling I think it's it's in my chest so that's a hard area to feeling it around the heart and what is there in that harder you pay attention to that that area in your heart but what do you find it was sort of things in findin yes it it's just a really just a compressing feeling just I noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feelings and I would like to suggest if you can say ah instead of page and see what happens in your body so go ahead you actually want me to just say okay yes my chest feels very tighter I feel very frustrated angry mm-hmm angry hmm so that's what's coming up frustration anger so what are you doing this moment with your anger as you essentially right here there chest this moment just just accepting it just thanks and once you accept of anger inside you what else do you do with that anger having accepted um it's it's just a pop it's just a part of me yeah notice he was saying it again I am firing these with our eye to thing that to acknowledge this is you know something out there good or what think something very strong but it out there thank you so it's a safe way to put it but you could say I feel angry I feel angry and who do you feel angry that my ex-husband yes your ex-husband hmm Sandra having just explored some of your feelings around the situation you have I'm going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair this may be a little uncomfortable but it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer and you'll be in dialoguing with a party that you are actually having to deal with and I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change okay let's bring Jeff and your imagination that the acid jet were here I'll bring a chair okay welcome Jeff I welcome Jeff your net and and there Jeff this imagine his face it looks like how you remember here and bringing in your fantasy and then when you're ready to just say whatever comes to you at that moment this moment spontaneous okay okay Jeff I feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the children in I don't think you understand how hard it is at times and the things that I have to explain to them about about this situation it bothers me that you don't go out of your way to spend extra time with the children and I really believe that in the future they they will come to to really resent that and and not look at you as as their father I honestly can't understand why you don't want to spend more time with them and irrespective of what's happened between between us and a moving on and and so for that I just don't think that that your children and my children should really suffer in that way I would like them to have us as normal a life as possible and and be able to to be with both of their parents and why you know what is so important rather than then wanting to be with them it's it's just very hard mm-hmm okay so there's a kind of question you understand why this happened etc right so what next thing we'll do your you'll silver there and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at that may be a little bit difficult but let's do a dialogue I see if you were he's not here anyway yeah so we'll we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff the imaginary chapter yeah and you in the present here and now okay and what is what is he signing with well go ahead I'm suggesting sit over there okay the moment you sit over there you become Jeff okay and whatever jeff says to the statement you made go ahead Jeff Sandra I know that it must have been hard on you and the kids with me leaving and it's not that I don't want to spend more time with them but I am very busy with with work and and a few other things that that are going on in my life and Sandra my children do mean a lot to me and you know if I was to spend more time with them though when I contact you about it I don't want you to be to be short and rude and and and I want you to be open to to the opportunity okay I'll stop you Jeff and say Sandra the children really mean a lot to me to say that if again the statement Sandra the children really do mean a lot to me okay so go back to there so check your frustration over the house do you feel different for about him now that he really cares for the children and there is a future may be with him in them you feel that yeah yeah so have you any appreciations to Jeff I know there are the hurts and frustration egg but any appreciation that he still cares for the children of the father I really don't have any appreciation for that because the reason that the reason that you've given that you're busy like I'm busy in my life and I still give our children priority they still take precedence in my life and I just don't think that that that that's right good and tell them what's her father you should be to the children you should be proactive in wanting to see them and I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than than what we have agreed if there are times when when you want to do something spontaneous and see them then then feel free to to contact us and and and see if it's okay good good good come over there Sal look at that a very good idea good offer is you Jeff are you prepared to take that off wrong for the kids sake well Sandra I'm glad that you said that and I think that something that I could look at but when I contact you I don't want you to be to be short with me or rude I I want you to consider it and and to be honest yeah great cover there so are you aware what's what's going on here the contracts happening okay aware that that seems into parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important that's the children so children will not suffer they will actually benefit from that agreement if you two can really really come to a mutual agreement to what how we gonna take care of the children mm-hm because this thing no matter how in my view no matter how people live together as a couple separate together the contract life countries I'm still my father too much Ilyas another dimension if we could only get that anger out frustration out we can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together even we don't may not live together we will live for the with the kids they'll be happy that make sense to you yes ah there's a but but how do i but it's a question good good good this is in a counseling session and he hasn't really participated in in forming this contract yes but you hear that this happened for you yes and you've done it so is there something that you now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him no matter how he is there's a now new realization that the children need that mother how's that for you yeah maybe I just need to to let him know that and just extend the invitation of having my talk about that yeah member yeah and you're good at that you're very good watching you working here you're very good at creating contracts very clear about what you want it's a question of how you can the two parties can get to that agreement together what do you think great that's this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen okay
