you well let me just free associate just a little bit about about sooo I'm I'm really struck with that very last thing you said Blaine that you ask her something and she laughs and says oh I wish you wouldn't have asked me that you know just like to sort of meditate on that a little bit what does that mean I mean ordinarily if you ask a patient a question that evokes things they there and $0.01 are grateful for your doing your you're doing your work but she says I wish you wouldn't have asked me that what do you make of that what does it feel like to you when she says that that she's she she feels like she's being put on the spot a little bit and she's having to look at feelings that she she did it I feel like there's this untapped area feeling that she's hesitant to go there and if I ask a question which sort of opens up the lid there she starts feeling that and she resists it and if you were to say to her you know for again if you were focused very much on the here and now in direction you were to say to her you know so I'm really struck when I when I asked you that question and you say I wish you wouldn't have asked that I'm thinking what that means you it it it makes me think that that this is really hard for you that it's a it's a painful thing there are things that it's very difficult for you to talk about is that what you mean by it what would she say she would she would say yeah I don't like looking at this I thought I'd put these feelings to bed years ago and and I it's hard for me to to bring them up again because for years I suffered with you know really low self-image and starting with my childhood and then through my marriage and for me to take an honest look at some of this it's it's hard it it it brings up old feelings sort of exists finds his identity by doing by performing something the idea of just sheer being mm-hmm he got to justify his existence by my performance in some way he's constantly anxious about that I'm just thinking as you're talking about someone that I saw in consultation just a couple of weeks ago he came from another country was just here briefly and I saw him for a couple of hours and I won't go into the whole story but but what was happening with him is that he had lost a very close friend been about two years before then but since then this was a man in his 50s and since then he has he's been very frightened of doing so many things that he could do with ease before that everything felt dangerous to him even swimming or skiing and so it was a lot of sort of manifest anxiety which is not unusual but when you lose someone I mean one of the aspects of grief that we don't often explore is the fact that the part of grief is that it's a confrontation with your own death and so with this particular person we began talking about there was so much death anxiety so that he became frightened everything so even we talked about death anxiety for a while and and then I I tried to explore with him about what there was about a death that frightened him that sounds like a stupid question I know but you know it really isn't you sort of technical well what happened the experience of death is so frightening to you and he got pretty quickly into the idea that there was so much that he hadn't done that he could have done
