okay hi I'm Nick hi I'm Brianna very nice to meet you can think see ya alright so you're a junior here at Saint Ben's this year I am okay how's that going how do you like being here good I really love school here and you know my third year I'm feeling like I'm finally like getting into the flow of things I know what I'm doing finally so yeah I love it here especially after three years being here you kind of get with close with your friends and yeah definitely I mean being an upperclassman oh it's really nice to you know actually know what I'm feeling like I'm getting somewhere yeah definitely great feeling yeah so um have you ever been here at the Counseling Center I actually haven't um you know three years here and this is my first time so okay gotcha um so I guess to start do you have any questions for me about how this is gonna work or anything um I guess just right off the bat yeah I'm just kind of wondering you know what I do when I'm here um - my parents need to know I'll just kind of what can I expect from this how everything goes yeah definitely just let you know because we work here on campus we pretty much exclusively see student clients and we kind of understand of all the things that go on campus and all the stresses that can go through midterms or future all just different things that can happen so we are here and everything we say here is completely confidential you're over 18 your parents don't need to know but the only thing that I would have to talk to authorities or your parents about is if legally I don't have to talk to them if you are imminent threat to yourself or others but other than that everything we've got here is a safe space everything stays in here okay better yeah so and also in this first section it's more just beginning to know you just talking through you're gonna be doing a lot of talking and I'll do a lot of listening just to see what we have here today what we're going to talk about it's all okay all right sounds good so to start off just a little get a little get to know you a little bit better and tell me about yourself and this year are things going okay well like you're you know I'm a junior here I played volleyball my first two years when okay I'm just gonna here thanks oh yeah this year I decided not to just because this school is getting kind of crazy and I had hurt my knee my freshman year and yeah so I mean it's not really bad how things used to be so I was I didn't yeah for my health and also I guess my sanity yeah that's something it to go from yeah college sport can take a lot out of you yeah every time consuming and the season is very long so that's been a changes here I decided and I would give that up and that I have a job on campus okay where do you work um I work in academic advising office and then I also work for the track coach so I'm busy with that very nice yeah yes other than that I mean I played I still play volleyball a lot okay thanks yeah I plan intramural teams actually coach the guys club team oh do you yeah fun yeah that's a little crazy 20 guys who don't know what they're really doing so definitely very involved yeah that's crazy but other than that I'm like you know what my friends I guess that that's what I do outside of school my classes take up a lot of time in my homework mm-hmm and one constantly feel like I don't live in the library yeah oh yeah especially now that you're getting up being a junior you have more major courses a lot more serious academic work yeah I think it's it's becoming to be more my life actually instead of just you know random classes that I'm taking a selfie that's kind of a different feeling and um I guess especially my major um I'm a Dietetics major okay and then I'm also a sec minor and that exercise science and sports studies oh yeah you are busy okay yeah I'm trying to pack in as much as I can yeah well that's awesome so about just the coming to why we're here today is there anything that's been going on that's been bothering me I'm actually kind of um well I I think they might beginning panic attacks all right I mean from what I can tell on what I've seen on Google and like WebMD and stuff but I'm an Oscar embarrassed to go anywhere else so I figured that this might be my best show about okay freaky not too much but yeah I think I've been having panic attacks really how can you describe them to me like what happens when you have these well I I get all nervous a kind of anxious feeling my heart starts to pound really fast and kind of flutter I'll even eat sweat sometimes I can't breathe and I think my throat is closing up yeah hyperventilate sometimes they make it nauseous all right you don't have really bad like stomach cramps and just I don't know the first time I seriously thought I was having a heart attack and I really freaked out but yeah after about 10 minutes it just kind of went away yeah those experiences gonna be very scary yeah definitely so when when do these kind of happen or how often um I mean anywhere anytime like I'll be sitting in the library or I don't know a few Friday nights ago I was actually watching a movie with my roommates and all of a sudden I just I couldn't breathe and I got all sweaty and they're like what's going on and you know I had to get up and I left the room and I you know got a drink of water and then after a few minutes it went away but okay no when they happen they're just so freaked me out so I don't really know him yeah what's going on exactly so these have been pretty recent yeah I would say molasses in the last few months okay and then every like week or so I'll kind of notice I have like a little episode of these okay yeah so I kind of want to get into a little more detail that time when you're with your friends watching the movie okay what do you think could have been the cause of is what movie were you watching that it was actually it was tangled that Disney one yeah yeah like the Rapunzel one yeah saw it so it's not scaring will be provoking these just feeling no I don't think so I don't really like they bring off the Disney wants for me okay nice so if it's not the movie er is there anything that you can think of that could have been a console fees or or especially in this case just watching movie with your friends anything in particular happen I mean I don't think so I have a fight with anyone I haven't you know I didn't have a test that day or anything that I don't know what it's just I think it came out of nowhere hmm okay so um just to kind of get a little better idea of what happened could you kind of go Reeth go through kind of what happened exactly their hands um overall in our living room just saying that me and my roommates and then we made popcorn so we did that and then oh my one roommate had checked her email right before and she found out that she got this huge internship that she really wanted oh very nice yeah so we're all kind of excited about that nice happy for her because she's been talking about it for months and you know trying to plan her whole summer around this internship and so okay that's really cool yeah when she found out she got it we're all super excited because I know that it's something that she was really looking forward to and she really wants to you know mm-hmm get in she said she can you know plan her future and stuff okay so yeah and then I guess after that meeting put in the movie and our popcorn and then a few minutes later I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing my heart was kind of racing okay um so kind of going back to that issue like she got that interview she or the internship are you playing you guys doing any of that as well like do you have any internships plan well Mike that's a nursing major I know she was trying to get one right now she was just applying actually like two nights ago for a bunch okay um but I mean I guess for me with my Dietetics major it's it's a little different than other majors um just because we in order to become a registered dietician I'm not able to actually get an internship okay before I graduation yeah so I feel like I don't know I I'm not able to do that yet I have to wait until after I graduate to find out anything internships but I know a lot of my friends are getting into that cuz I mean we're juniors now and so it's like next year's in it so this is everyone kind of has to start planning openings for what they want to do and try and get a feel for that yeah that can be a scary thing trying that transition now I have to know what I have to do and now that your friends do you feel like that's an issue for you feeling like oh maybe I'm falling behind I'm not getting his over I mean at times and I almost like there's really no way for me to prepare myself after graduation okay it's their bite when you say that there's no way for you to prepare a word we have a pretty good college background here what do you why don't you think you don't have any opportunities or well it's just everyone else is like figuring out what they exactly want to do like my ring my one roommate and all she really she loves babies so she's going to be a nurse so I mean she's all about peds and she knows that's where she wants to fly and that's where she wants to work and another roommate she is in global business and dream is to like manage a pro hockey team and you know all these different things and they have like these specific goals set out and then you know I'm sitting here with my major and it's like okay well I'm going into Dietetics but there's so many different places I can go with that but I don't really know what I want to do because I mean there's not really that opportunity for me to you know take this internship or you know we do this in the summer because I essentially can't go and you know give advice to people in their lifestyles or you know look at the biochemistry of this because I'm not registered so no one really trusts you that can be scary gonna feel like you don't know where that next steps gonna take so when you're looking into you said you can't have them now is that correct yeah until after graduation yes so far I guess my majors and it's kind of more you start off on the Dietetic strap and so you do that here and then after graduation you have to apply for an unpaid internship I mean so I most of them when I've heard of their unpaid and so you have to do that for a year 9 months or okay ever long and then after that you have to take your tests and then you find out if you become registered or not okay are you looking forward to taking this a year unpaid internship with you I mean it's kind of freaking me out because I still don't know what I want to do and then it's like okay well I have to apply for this internship you know I don't get paid for it yeah the amount of internships in Minnesota are pretty slim so essentially that would mean me having to move away you know leaving my family leaving my friends I've been a Minnesota my whole entire life and me my family are really close so yeah I would be leaving them and I don't know the whole it's just everything was so unknown so I don't know what I'm doing I mean if I actually even moved to a different state my family is not going to be there my friends are gonna be there like Who am I gonna live with yeah how am I gonna pay for my girl shoes if I don't have a job like I don't know if I'm gonna be able to have a job yeah that is a very great thing a year is a long time for one not to get paid in that finger of student loans or and two especially if you have to move away you don't have those people to rely on it feels like maybe you're you're like you've said you're very close to your family and your friends here it's you're almost losing that close-knit is that kind of do you think that could be that's yeah I mean that's how I'm kind of feeling right now it's like everything so uncertain and then you know if I leave am I am I still gonna have my friends if I have to move to a different state and then when I come back like am I still gonna be friends of them am I gonna you know be able to Skype my mom I think that's gonna be different yeah I mean the only time that's ever happened to me is I went to Spain for a month but that was one month yeah and I you know I got to talk to her on the phone and I mean I don't know it just kind of freaks me out that I'm not gonna have my family there that you know pick me up if I fall or my friends to be there so when I come home and I had a bad day that I have someone to talk to like well if ever lived by myself I'm not gonna know what to do yeah that little bit month that you said your weight so that was a little taste and you're just thinking oh now that I'm gone for this much longer how am I gonna be able to cope with that yeah I mean in that month that was like I mean it wasn't much I was I was in a different country granted but I mean I was there studying abroad and it was a fun time in my 30 other people so I knew people but if I moved Tony I don't know I don't even know anyone in different states yeah so I mean I'm not gonna have anyone five to move away yeah the futures effect can be a pretty scary place now that you're transitioning into an unknown like you said and I'm a junior so I mean it's it's coming up fast yeah definitely can you talk about maybe another time that you had a panic attack mmm-hmm I'm trying to think I just had one very recent actually a few days ago I don't know if you notice on campus but there was a Career Expo going on um and I don't know I know that night I was actually laying in my bed and my roommate had just come home from the Career Expo and she had gone and was you know telling me how she was talking with all these potential employers and getting all excited and really hoping for this internship and that internship and oh maybe I can work here and then even that day when I was walking around campus you know all the boys are in a nice suits and jackets and ties and everything and then no girls are wearing their heels and their dress pants and their skirts and walking on through resumes and business cards and you know looking like they're going somewhere with their lives and I was that what does it mean so so that that same thing where you're feeling all people are figuring out their lives and I'm still left behind in uncertainty is that kind of still what triggered this you know I think so because I just remember I was sitting in the library and I think one of those sessions had just got not me I just saw like you know 50 people just walking through and they're all dressed up and they're carrying their portfolios and I was sitting there studying for a test and I was like wow like I feel like they're so prepared and I'm looking at ID when I'm like well I know he's a sophomore and she's a sophomore and I know they're my age so it's like I feel like they're getting so ahead of me and I'm just kind of you know falling behind yeah that definitely offended me a scary thing so when you do get these thoughts of it seems a lot of Europe it's the uncertainty that's causing this these panic attacks like and when you have these certain thoughts do you ever think what could I be doing yeah I mean at this point I don't really know I'm trying to prepare myself but I don't really know if him I don't know what I'm doing yeah especially I know one thing on campus which is great like as you've seen in the expo for the businesses they do the campus sets up a lot of activities for different majors and minors like for your career now you're a junior you want to be a Dietetics to go help people in nutrition maybe you can look into have you went to the Career Center looking into other opportunities that you may not know about that well actually I'm one of my profs just sent us an email and said that we actually have like a networking kind of thing like the business people had this last week and we have that one next week okay that can be helpful definitely yeah I mean I'm I think I'm gonna go to it I think that that might help me a little bit um I guess I'm still kind of I don't know I just feel like I'm so behind and I mean maybe talking to those people and seeing what they're doing with their lives and how they got there would help me figure out what I want to do with mine and how would I know how to get there yeah definitely so that overall unreal issues that we have during these soft panic attacks and I'm assuming that our goal today is to really try to help cope with these panic attacks it's become so what I try to advise to you is when we get these panic attacks when you have these panic attacks try to think of these all these negative thoughts and think of now thinking of trying to put them in a more positive perspective to think okay everyone else is going and I'm a being left behind but you also have to remember you also have that choice to be proactive and maybe I know you can't get that internship until after graduation but in the meantime there's things I can do for staff my resume or help consolidate some of my interests that to see oh I do really like this alright do really like that being proactive in that way so when you do get start getting those negative thoughts by helping suppress these negative thoughts and be more proactive about them maybe that could help your help eliminate these attacks that you have yeah I think I think that would help you know try to I guess like I can't control that I can't not get my internship until after and then I guess essentially I can't control that you know I might have to move away yeah but I mean I guess there are a few internships in Minnesota mm-hmm and I have heard of um they're kind of like outreach programs yeah so it's like and also schools and he's close to it where the internship is actually at the hospital like in Boston or something like that but then the st. cloud hospital or even the Children's Hospital they like they pair up with them so I mean I know there are opportunities that I would be able to stay here and you'll be close to my family and be close to my friends but it still freaks me out knowing that it's a possibility that I couldn't see that's a perfect example of there are opportunities that you could be product of about instead of because a lot of times in panic attacks we still we generalize the situation we think of the worst-case scenario it's like you are when you get into those situations you can think okay I'm I'm in the vague kind of state of mind where I think it won't work but at the same time maybe I can start thinking of ways that I can make certain things work we're starting to run short on time but but I think for some homework for next time would be great if when you start having panic attacks if you could write out like when what what's going on and then write kind of the thoughts that are going through your head at that time and then kind of like I was talking about thinking of how ways you can be proactive and positively think about the situation and also the next time you can bring those in and we can talk over this and kind of question these thoughts about your future and I'll think of some options that can help you look forward what you can do okay all right all right thank you
