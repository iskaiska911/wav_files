okay hi Phil oh yeah so given that this is our first session I thought perhaps I'd start say a little bit about the way I work about how the sessions going to be constructed and then we'll get onto the issues that are bothering you does that sound okay okay so thank you for your letter your referral letter which tells me a little bit about why you've come but it's important that we set a few kind of ground rules and kind of boundaries around the work so what I want to tell you is that anything in that or that we talk about is confidential okay there are times when I might need to talk to gp's people like that but that would only ever happen with your written permission okay my notes are kept safe I write very kind of factual notes so just a kind of very brief description of what we've talked about and any particular issues that come up and you have access to those notes through me if you want to see them okay otherwise they're confidential and the only time I would break confidentiality is if I was seriously concerned about your well-being or about the safety and well-being of anybody else okay if you had a bit of counseling before uh yeah yeah many many years ago okay okay what do you remember of that I found it a really useful experience really just to just to talk things through about ten sessions okay okay and did that end because it felt like it was enough yeah that's fine yeah okay the way I work may or may not be different that's if I just tell you a little bit about the kind of things that I'm interested in and how I imagine the sessions to go so one of these is the sessions of 15 minutes long and you don't need to worry about the time that's my responsibility yes but I would like us to meet on a regular basis and I think you know in your referral we talked about maybe we meeting weekly for say six sessions six to eight sessions then we can review yeah so if we agree to meet at this time every week for the next six weeks yeah the kind of things I'm interested in are relationships so our relationship I'm interested in how we work together and whether that mirrors anything of what you're experiencing in other relationships either with people or maybe things you know your relationship with work maybe and I'm also kind of interested in in your early relationships so how those may have impacted on how things are now okay I mean we'll kind of see where it goes yeah but what I'd really like in the sessions is for you to just talk about anything anything that comes to mind really you know if you have a particular dream or a kind of you know daydream or thoughts that you kind of mull over in the week you know bring them here and maybe we can use those to help us understand what's going on yeah yeah okay great and if any any point you're feeling you know uncomfortable with me or with the sessions be really helpful if we could find a way of talking about that okay all right so should we begin with the issues that you you put down on your referral and the issues that you're kind of bringing today yeah okay so what's going on for you what's going on for me right then I was I'm feeling a bit anxious to get started yeah what actually the things that I'm coming with is that recently I've been feeling a bit stressed and anxious about about things in general which is I I think it's unusual for me right and I'm aware of the fact that I that link to that is that I will take things on and I have things to do and I'm really good at putting those off or putting some of the things off okay so sorry I I see that those that those are connected yeah okay and you also connected feeling a bit anxious here which I guess is another one of those things that you said you'd do and actually know his perhaps a bit unnerving yeah yeah absolutely so meeting somebody new for the first time and in this setting is anxiety-provoking yeah yeah and maybe that's similar to what you're saying is you take on these things you agreed to do these things but actually what you end up feeling is quite anxious about it yeah yeah yeah yeah okay you also said this was a bit new when when does it feel like things have changed I probably probably a couple of maybe six weeks ago yeah I think that was quite recent clearly when I would ask the I I'd get symptoms of not exactly panic not that I don't see mister I'm not I don't have a panic attack sure but I can I can feel like a rising sort of panic here yeah yeah and like then then that can feel you've ended up feeling a bit sort of nausea s-- there and and and you know having to really sort of breathe to just sort of calm down I'm not quite feeling that at the moment oh that's but that happened as I say probably about six weeks ago happen for a couple of weeks and then just kind of leveled off again and that was the first time I'd ever experienced okay do you remember that very first time having difficulty remembering the the very first time okay very time that comes to mind I could think of the time that's representative of that okay what what what came to mind just feeling overwhelmed to think just being aware of the fact that I needed to go and do things and some of the things were you know things that maybe I put off I'm just feeling just feeling as though there was overwhelmed too much going on and yet when I sat down and tried to work it out because I like to be able to do that I like to be in to say this is connected to this sure when I tried to put my finger on was the one specific thing I I couldn't do that it was just there was a collection of small things which when I looked at them each in turn they were all manageable but the collective seemed to be a bit a bit overwhelming really okay and these things that were felt overwhelming were they all placed him you know to do with one aspect of your life or is this a kind of general I think that they probably when I think about it there were probably aspects of work where they were but there but it but it's not it's not exclusive to work this there's there's there's other things you know there's this things within the home they learn for it just just very practical things like maybe you know doing some some DIY at home that I really should have done you know that's a very simple and you know something that sounds to me like a really trivial example but but it's yeah but what you're saying is it's not one thing for the individual doing the bit of DIY is not problematic no but feels problematic because all these other things there's so many of them yeah okay so is that something that feels new that you've taken on so it's such an array of things or is that something you've done in the past I think I'm very good at taking on things in the and I've done that in the past but I've I suppose that they've always been manageable I've always managed I've always managed to work through them even though I might have in my head a list of things to do they've always been they've always been achievable and they've always been they've always been sort of I'm just struggling a bit for the words yeah I suppose it's a matter of me sort of I've always managed to break them down and just deal with it with these things one at a time and so they haven't been overwhelming but the but that I suppose that I can identify that I'm very good at saying yes I'll do something and especially if it's a few but if it's a few months down the line and then I can I'll say yes to them and then all of a sudden what was a few months down the line suddenly is you know next week oh sure or today okay okay so that that thing of saying yes there's something you really resonate with and it feels like that's that's part of who you are yeah yeah yeah okay so do you make any sense of that what's your understanding of why you say yes I think that I say yes because I find it difficult to say no okay and I suppose that sort of linked in with that is you know I don't like to sort of let people down I don't I don't want to disappoint people so my guess is that would be very alive in our meetings that there'd be a part of you I guess that we'd want to get it right Oh wouldn't want to let me down maybe yeah yeah yeah I can see that yeah okay yeah yeah okay so that's just for us to kind of notice and recognize really because there may be times in here where you do want to challenge something I say or you know maybe you don't want to turn up one week or I'll go do something else what might that feel like right to not make the appointment or to write not get it right yeah yeah whatever hmm does that bring anything up for you that idea of letting someone down or say no yeah as soon as you said that as soon as I thought about it that just thought that just doesn't feel that doesn't sit well with me that doesn't feel comfortable okay yeah so it would be really difficult to do that yeah yeah so it must be very hard for you to say no to things even when they feel like it's another demand yes yeah yeah I think I can do it right but it doesn't it doesn't it's hard right it's hard for me to do okay to say a bit about I I don't quite know where to go with that yeah okay I feel so it's really uncomfortable or a bit I feel I feel a bit stuck there okay yeah okay yeah so that might really be helpful for us to see that that's the place where it it feels stuck that that it's difficult to even imagine saying no to somebody refusing to do things in a kind of easy way that it would be something quite challenging yes I have to kind of prepare myself yeah it's far easier for me to say yeah go on I'll do it yeah that's fine put my name down or I'll take that arm okay whereas if I yeah I'll have to get to the point where I'm thinking oh there's I've just got too much there's too much going on for me to actually I suppose to get myself to the point where I can turn around to somebody and say no I can't do that and so it's the easier option is to say yeah except I guess what you're telling is it's not necessarily the easiest option in the long run no it's no good because then I end up in that place where I ended up taking too much arm and then you can't really sort of I feel as though then I then I feel as I'll really be letting somebody down if I say yes just to something yeah sure and then I then I would really gonna be letting somebody down she said it seems I'm sitting here and I'm talking about it it logically it seems it'd be far easier if I just when they first asked me you don't say no no but it may be almost habitual that you say yes like that's because a real patent for you yeah yeah okay would do ha does that fit in at all with any of your kind of early experiences of life does anything come to mind school family what's come to mind there is that is that I was my strategy for forgetting through secondary school I went to I'm believing the do the the standard sort of you know the small primary school I'm getting going into secondary school which was a comprehensive in Liverpool and suddenly I was I remember the first day standing there and just being I suppose overwhelmed by by the size of the other new place I've got to and I think as a strategy for coping fairly early on and the in in that school was with the kind of it was to sort of keep your head down and sort of just get on with it and I suppose maybe the connection there might be just to sort of be is to not be resistant to stuff and be compliant with stuff but I don't know whether that's right but certainly as you were talking about there's early memories that that's a very powerful memory of me that that's the way I got through secondary school if you you know if you keep your head down then then people won't target you okay yeah okay sounds like it was quite hard to school it was I suppose that looking back on it I I don't see it quite like that but I guess at the time when I was eleven I stand in there yeah Aminu blazer then that was a scary place yeah and I guess that's the bit that feels really relevant is that that was your experience your your experience of going to that school on that first day was that it was big and scary and somehow another you needed to find a method of staying safe I'm keeping a head down being compliant saying yes was what happened yeah yeah what about in your home was your home a place where you could say no the memories I have of home was that was a very that the home was a very safe place I think that but but I don't think I actually I don't think I said no but I don't think it was I don't think I was I don't think there was anything there that would that I was a wet that I'm aware of no I would have been concerned about hmm like I say it was it felt a very safe place a very loving place so I didn't get its all shouted at mm-hmm but but I don't know whether that's because at that point I'd already develop this sort of you know just keep quiet mmm I've done really every thought that far back okay yeah yeah yeah all made that connection and and there might not be a connection yeah there may be other may may not be I mean that the connection might be that home did feel safer and it wasn't a place where you were avoiding conflict so maybe going to the secondary school was the stark contrast to that right a place that really didn't feel safe yeah that feels more like it yeah and somehow or another that method of coping yeah of keep your head down just say yes has stayed with you yeah yeah even though the danger is probably less than yes yeah yeah yes remember we're colleague many years ago said that I sort of had this how did he describe it because he was quite an active person and sort of standing up and shouting or standing up and making his point felt and I think that my he described me as having a cloak of invisibility the the you know that I just found a level to sort of get on with and to drift through as opposed okay yeah which I kind of took at the time as a sort of a compliment to think right how about it looks like you're questioning that yeah yeah it's if that's kind of connected to this they're not wanting to sort of you know not wanting to make ripples and just a sort of and therefore taking on stuff and not saying no to people then I don't think that that sounds like it's not it's not oh I've always seen it as a fairly useful strategy well now maybe that maybe it's not if that's well maybe it's both because I think that you know what you described happening to you a really quite young age at school was that you actually found a method of coping that actually did work it sounds like you didn't get picked on at school did manage to find a way through it and actually that served you very well yeah most of the time but perhaps what you're saying to me is it's not serving you so well right now right yeah yeah maybe there's something that's changed in your life at the moment or the situation has changed whereby that method of coping is actually becoming a problem well yes yeah yeah I can see I can see how that connects and I can see how that what's going off of me at the moment is not good in this sense there I'm getting to the point where yeah I've been there relatively sort of anxiety free and you know I might see feeling as on yeah that's the dots not what's going on for me at the moment yeah okay so should we go back to that six weeks ago because it felt like that was really relevant that something really changed for you all right at that point yeah and what you're saying is it's not clear what it was in particular had you taken on more than normal I'm really not aware that I take none anymore than usual and and when I as I said when I just kind of sat down and tried to work it out I couldn't I couldn't put my finger on any my life as I said earlier I can't put my finger on one thing it was just it just seemed like a collection of things hmm really so I'm I'm hard push to think is there something with something specific happening maybe unconnected i mean sometimes it can be something like an anniversary or a birthday or you know a whole range of things but it feels like something shifted for you yeah hmm all that all that springs to mind there is that I've been working at the same place for 25 years so and that happened around that time that it was that it was acknowledged there are that I beam that I've been working get the same place for 25 years and and so I and I don't I dunno where that came from I don't know I mean apart from you got she's saying kind of verse because I really can't think that that is necessarily connected to me feeling anxious but it might be sounds like a significant event yeah yeah was that you know golden handshake or something you know yeah yes yeah and you're saying it was acknowledged it was but I was it was I think part of me thinks that it wasn't very well acknowledged maybe and and I remember at the time feeling like I saw I had a question over whether I was actually being valued and even as to say that now that kind of the desert is it a I feel an emotional connection to that I thought that kind of feels you know feels like there's something going on and and yet how that connects or doesn't it from you know this this whole thing about you know a significant event not particularly feeling valued by the response I got further and and we get anxious well I guess one connection that we could make quite quickly I guess is something about what you're saying is that you you do say yes you do take on work yeah but actually from your perspective you know you you give what you've got to give and and there may be some connection in in that that that actually you know you've given as much as you can you've taken on all these things and yet somehow it doesn't feel like it's quite valued enough so maybe it leaves you a bit invisible does that was the night yeah don't what I do with it okay yeah yeah well I guess maybe you don't need to do anything with it maybe just acknowledging that feels like a step forward because what you're saying is this event happened and it almost feels like you sort of felt it and pushed it away so when I mentioned was there anything significant you know that came to mind and and as you said there's an emotional response to it so it is significant there is something that's really important and it's fairly recent yeah yeah how would you have liked to have been recognized no idea is that weird I don't know hmm I think part of me thinks not maybe not at all you know well that's interesting I don't know where to go with that I don't know I I don't know never thought never never thought about it and even as I'm sitting here now try and think about it I just don't like I just have no idea yeah yeah okay I may be that going blank just tells us that it's a bit difficult to think about you know I mean I think certainly my experiences when feelings are kind of powerful it is really hard to think and I'm also aware that this isn't our only session so there's time for us to come back to that if it feels open yeah yeah and some of these things that we're kind of linking together you know maybe you'll go away and Mull that over and and it will make more sense yeah maybe not yeah but but I guess you know it what feels really helpful is the fact that what you have allowed to happen is just thoughts to come to your mind right yeah and what you're saying is you know why did that thought come in why why that orig but it feels important mm-hmm yeah something about being recognized in a positive way which your cloak of invisibility perhaps denies you yeah is the negative part of being not recognized and being able to get through the difficult beds yeah do you want to say a little bit more about you mentioned the word procrastination earlier yes okay and that's linked to all these things that I say I'll take on I think there's I think that procrastination kind of sits in lots of areas of my life really there's things I'd like to there's things I'd like to do um I think I'd like to do mm-hmm and then and then find reasons not to do them and so there's obvious things when I sort of say to other people that I'll do something and then I'll be in a situation where I have to do it or or will say no but there's things that I also kind of expect from myself this like that of things that I want to achieve for me some of which I do and some of which I push off and and I suppose when I put them off either end I thought thing I ever really get myself a hard time about it but it's just another something else that I've put off and I would I feel as I'd like to do an example of that might be years ago I thought I felt as I was really quite creative yeah I yeah I'd sit and draw I play guitar right right and I still play guitar and and I still sort of know still sort of promised myself I'm gonna sit down and and draw but I think that sort of laughingly I've I say to myself ah that's the kind of thing I'll do when I retire I'll take up watercolors when I retire and so I always manage to sort of put something off and yet there's part of me that thinks that's really important hmm that it's really important for me to hmm do these things for me and then I don't do them and I just feel and then I feel kind of I don't know what I'm not sure what I feel about that really I feel a bit sort of the word that springs to mind is I feel a bit disconnected disconnected to to a path of me I suppose and I don't know where that's coming from either but the other left that's what's in my mind at the moment can you describe that part of you I suppose it's the I suppose I just describe it as added earlier honest or sort of a creative the creative side or the creative part hmm it's the part that gives me it's a part that I've feel as I've neglected as opposed so maybe a neglected part of me mm-hmm and as I say that that feels a bit uncomfortable as well where does not feel uncomfortable give me my body mmm that feels it sort of sits somewhere it just sits somewhere here mm-hmm I think it's hard to mmm how to describe that nice but I just feel as a suppose a bit maybe that bits a bit sort of a part of me that I've that I've sort of left behind or lost hmm and I would like to reconnect to old me yeah reclaim yeah just sort of get back in touch with and and and I feel as though that's important to leave me for me because it will make me sort of more more whole more rounded it's almost like I put that on one side to get on with other stuff okay and the other stuff is probably work yeah yeah do you enjoy your work I enjoy parts of my work yeah yeah yeah but obviously at the time when I'm feeling quite overwhelmed with women's a bit then I dunno I kind of don't yeah yeah yeah so there's I mean I guess if I reflect something that that's going on for me is I keep going back to this cloak really right you know I think it's a really interesting image isn't it this cloak of invisibility right and and and the reason it's there in my mind is cuz I'm thinking or what does a cloak do and it and yes it would enable you to not be seen and go through yeah but also maybe it covers up something right and the things you're talking about being creative you know making music making art and those kind of things you know that they're kind of things that are seen aren't they alright are an expression of yourself somehow they've been covered up so this other part of you that gets on with it I think is what you said yeah is able to do that yeah hmm but it feels now split off you'd like that back yes yeah and I guess having that back partly involved saying no well that's right it would be I did the same no would free up the free up more time yeah but then I don't know whether I would make use of that time but whether I would just sit and procrastinate and and not you know find reasons not to do that okay yeah okay so it feels like you're suggesting that that actually there's something within you that both wants the creative bit but also does things to prevent it from happening yeah yeah there's no reason why I can't yeah there's no reason why I can't find time it's it's you know there's you know I can go and I'm quite happily in sit in front of the television when I could actually be doing something more creative so what comes up for you if I suggest you know that you you you dive into that creativity I feel like I think it feels a bit risky like uh so it's you know I used to do it so long ago I don't really know was I could do it anymore and so to actually try it might mean that I realized that I can't do it or can't do it as well as I like to think I'd be able to do it mm-hmm I think there's an element of that in there so fear of not getting it right huh yeah mm-hmm so it's easy for me to stick with things that I know I can get right hmm then to take on something which is you know I might get well you can't technically get a creative piece wrong but it may not be as as good as I would like it to be mmm so that's where the self critic lies that there's a sense that you would have an expectation of yourself and if you didn't live up to it mmm that would be difficult yeah yeah hmm is that critical I've in them in your work or in other aspects of your life maybe doesn't be it doesn't really feel as though it's there my work okay did you say that like in fact part of me feels though it's it's it's not exactly the opposite but part of me feels as though I'm quite happy getting things wrong I I you know I actually I'm quite happy believing that that that's that that just gives me some you know some opportunities to do something better if I had to get something wrong you know I would learn from mistakes that yeah it kind of thing and yet that doesn't apply when I'm thinking about so maybe wanting to do a better sit down and draw or paint yeah so really display they're really odd that's a very odd thing doesn't make sense to me at all hmm have you realized that before no no no and yeah I'm really I'm really yeah when I say to me I've always said to my kids when they if they do something wrong if the first time they do something wrong I never tell them off when they do something wrong they they probably hate me for it but my my mantra is what did you learn from that hmm yeah and then if they do it wrong the second time then then they can get shouted at because they haven't learned something from it and so I'm actually think I'm very open to this idea of get you know get it wrong and you learn something from it yeah and yet that is exactly what's not going on when it comes to sitting down and being creative hmm which I just I'm not brand new to me right absolutely I've never thought of never made that never thought about it never made that's I can say that Justin's made that that really just genuinely doesn't make sense to me hmm yeah that I'd have to get something absolutely right first time over here not having done it for 15 years mm-hmm and yet over here I'm quite happy to make mistakes hmm acknowledge them hmm to feel so there's something very precious about the creative aspect of you whereas it feels like an your work your bit more robust you're able to to get it wrong suppose have more confidence in the work and in other areas of my life being creative is while I only well I while I would only be doing that for me anyway but I don't feel confident that is they're doing it just for me Hector do you think because it sounds like you do a lot of things for other people in they're saying yes I'm taking on the things what you said was you didn't want to let anybody down or disappoint anybody I could I can see that I hadn't really haven't really thought about that that's me that's gone like just kind of I've just blanked that's I don't know what happened there in that sense but there was I was following that train of thought and then I just lost it again I think there's something that that you've really kind of demonstrated here which is that you know those moments when when we we stopped being able to think yeah are often moments where it actually feels like something's really resonating and and I think sometimes you just have to sit with that mm-hmm yeah we could rush in with all sorts of ideas about here but that really might not be helpful yeah yeah we're coming towards the end of the session and angry and it feels as though it's been incredibly full right yeah yeah my experience of the session yeah as if there's been you know we've been to school we've been you know many places really and I guess what will happen over the week is that some of that will kind of you know you're mulling over or it might spark things in your imagination it might impact on your sleep and your dreams you know and and what I would encourage you to do is just just let that happen yeah bring back what feels relevant to the next session right and we'll see if we can make some more sense out of things right okay it's been a real pleasure getting three years yeah is that is that food how long have we been talking we've been talking for 50 minutes Wow no does it feel like there's less I feel like that too like it's gone quickly yeah yeah okay great okay so I'll see you the same time next week thank you xena thank you so much for agreeing to be filmed today and if you're willing I was just hoping to ask you a few questions about your approach and the session that you've just delivered okay first of all can you tell me a little bit about your approach to counselling and psychotherapy yeah well my training is psychoanalytic like a dynamic and my approach differs in some ways depending on the setting so for example if I'm working in my private practice seeing people for several years yeah my technique as it were would be much less active yeah so I'd be much more willing to sit back and although I'm very much interested in the relationship with the client I would probably say a lot less and ask a lot less questions and would have an awareness that if something came up you know I don't need to make an interpretation about that until the clients ready so I would you know be much slower in a sense and be very much more working on a kind of relational basis in other work that I do are the settings that I work the work is much briefer so maybe six to ten sessions that kind of thing and in that work I'm a lot more active and I think a lot of modern psychodynamic therapists are a lot more active really so the things that as I said in the beginning of the session really the things that I'm particularly interested in our relationships so I'm interested in people's relationships with their families with their current people in their lives I'm interested in their relationship with me and how that plays out and how they might work with me and I'm really interested in their relationship with themselves so just as happened in in the session what people often realize is that they would describe you know different parts of themselves yeah you know there's a bit of me that really likes doing things and there's a bit of me that's really scared of getting it wrong and we have a conflict with that really interested in internal relational conflicts certainly you know my ideas about therapy and counseling are that and we can't change the outside world and actually the outside world isn't really necessarily the problem the problem is how we feel about that and our feelings are their internal relationships and usually people come to counseling when there's a conflict some sort of internal conflict so answer the question yeah that's that's brilliant you mentioned before the the modern approach and I'm just wondering how the moderns like dynamic therapy differs from the traditional approach the textbook approach if you like it's often reported and linked to Freud and that's hugely different so I think I think psychoanalytic and psychodynamic gets bad press I'd like to say that because what people do is they talk about Freud and it's a bit like no matter no looking at a money Morris Minor in comparison to a modern car you know it just doesn't work the traditional Freudian kind of way of working would be somebody on the couch for you know five five sessions a week the the the therapist being very much a blank screen etc etc modern psycho therapies are very different to that it's very much more relational people you know would come maybe once twice a week sit facing each other you know all of the kind of core concepts of counseling would be there in terms of the relational part of it I also think that the theorists modern theorists have have a huge lot to give really so most psychodynamic people would be thinking about things like attachments you know and working with kind of in their minds we'd be thinking about attachment theory they'd be thinking about Klein in oh I certainly work on a kind of kleinian idea of object part objects-- within the self and and in a way you know the client described that brilliantly by saying you know there's different aspects of me and of course some of those aspects we can know about because we're conscious and some of them are more revealed in our unconscious worlds so dreams and free association use of words you will have noticed in the session that you know the words that the client used I would pick up on because there's a whole gamut of words one can use it's very interesting why why those ones come to mind and the free association is still there but it's there in the way that as the clients and we all the first thought I had was or all that takes me back to that would be considered to be free association very different to a sort of you know word game wouldn't happen now and so just looking at the session and reflecting on the session that you've just delivered can you tell me a little bit about the relationship that that you felt developed with that client and can you tell me if you experienced any of the textbook psychodynamic dimensions like transference and those types of parts of the relationship yeah in terms of how the relationship went I mean the session was full the client seemed to talk quite openly I think there were a couple of times where he seemed very reflective as if as if something was going on internally that was difficult to perhaps communicate or difficult to articulate and and that felt for me as though that was very much part of a first session that it would take time really to build a relationship where somebody's you know really able to say whatever comes into their minds but my sense of it was that there was an element of warmth and I was very interested and and and and really appreciated it when the client talks about the the issues that had emotional resonance really and it felt at those moments that there was there was a good rapport really but I'd say it was something that one builds on you know and that the relationship is something that develops over time and is an incredibly powerful part of the work that I do and again reflecting on the session that you just delivered I'm just wondering if there are any specific techniques that were used so transference analysis and dream analysis free association you mentioned some of the free association but any of the typical technique I think I mean if you look at there was a part in the session I think when I said something about how his relationships with other people might well be mirrored in our work together that it might be difficult to let me down and that that was a kind of very tentative interpretation you know it wasn't necessarily something that was happening in the session but I think I said it just to open that as a possibility of something we could explore later so my experience wasn't that he was desperately trying to please me or that that fitted to any of the relationships we've talked about but my guess is that over time if you know if those things were relevant they would they would become more obvious I mean I think you know transference interpretation is not something one would rush into yeah you you know you would spend quite a lot of time thinking about it experiencing it my own countertransference would be really important you know what was going on for me what was I feeling did I feel I kind of propelled to behave in a way that's not my natural way and that certainly didn't happen in the session but it but you know it might be something that one would look for the free association I think was very much there and I really appreciated his willingness to just say what came into his mind and go back to those places that felt relevant I think there was certainly kind of using symbolic language felt very much as though it was there and that's something that I would pick up and I think it's quite a textbook concept really so for example the cloak of invisibility I used to help us make some sense out of things and the fact that it had been presented in the session for me means it's relevant again there are thousands of ways of describing things but the language the words people use are often you know really really relevant really important and I think can really help somebody to make sense of something yeah thank you very much Tina thank you again for agreeing to be filmed and for delivering the session and thank you for answering the questions thank you you
