well hi Brittany thanks for joining me today oh thank you for talking with me today yeah how's your day going so far it's going good it's been a pretty peaceful morning and I got to do some coaching myself this morning so that what a great way to start your day it looks all sunny in your room right now yes it is gotta love SoCal it's like back to being sunny now you know a few days are raining we all freak out right well I really appreciate you coming today I'll kind of just start off with a little bit of like what today will look like so that you kind of have a good insight into that so I'll start off with a quick introduction of myself I know we know each other a little bit but I'll still go over that and then what we're gonna go into was you know kind of what your expectations are and priorities are with this process I'll probably get some more information as far as kind of what your your actual big dreams are and then we'll narrow that down into your goals we do a thing that we call a wellness vision which is essentially you kind of thinking up your dream health behaviors and what that looks so go into that and just as an FYI I'm gonna be taking notes throughout and these notes are just something that I have so I can always go back when in between a question so we can kind of keep track of things they're completely confidential so no one else sees them but I just want to let you know so if you hear some typing that's you know entering an email or anything like that taking some notes throughout do you have any questions so far mm-hmm okay so a little bit about myself um you know I've been coaching for was part of sick unbelievable to say but over 12 years now yeah and I started it when I was a master student and I did it in a clinical setting and then I kind of grew and started my own business and my real passion is working with women and I love working with women so that I can really help them learn how to love themselves I know that's kind of cliche but it's a it's the reason why I do it and so many women are out there experiencing the health industry may be a negative light and my goal is to try to kind of fix that help them have positive experiences with health behaviors so that's kind of my own personal passion and coaching philosophy and you know I do have my my PhD in this field and my master's in this field and so I have the credentials but really where all my experience comes from and I think how this goes so well is because I have some really awesome clients so happy that you're here and part of it and I appreciate your time today this chin is a little longer than most sessions so usually when we meet it's about 60 minutes for the main sessions but today might go over just a little bit so I just want to make sure you're comfortable with that timing yeah that's fine thank you yeah okay so let me just start off with some expectation settings because I know a lot of times we come into health and wellness coaching and we have this kind of maybe idea of what it's like and then we're like well that's that's not it so health and wellness coaching is a relatively new field in the health field and it the techniques that I primarily use which is called motivational interviewing that comes from this background of people who are working with people who have substance abuse and so they did a ton of research on that and what they found was that this kind of quote-unquote therapy or use this motivational interviewing can be really really successful in helping people make sustained long-term behavior so about 10 to 15 years ago we started to use that in the health field and we've seen some really incredible benefits um and so coaching and health of almost coaching is gonna be very different than many probably of the other experiences you've had in the fitness industry and that throughout our conversation today you're gonna see that you're gonna be driving the conversation right it's very centered you're you're the one who's driving what's important what we're talking about so I'll ask a lot of questions and I'll do a lot of I'll do the least amount of talking and you're gonna do talking so this is the most amount of talking about you're looking to have fun so like I said it's a financial piece I do keep notes but that's just for our own records and then you know the coaching process is supposed to be just kind of this really safe and brave space for you to be able to open up and talk about the things that you really care about particularly blended into your health so is there anything in particular coming in today that you want to get out of coaching I think just clarity on next steps because sometimes I can get stuck and what to do next - as it received better health ok so just some clarity some specifics or what you can do next right huh ok great so I think that this process will definitely help with that yeah check in and see if it has okay great so what we're about to go into is creating the Wellness vision and a wellness vision is this this idea and this thought of who do we want to be right who is our best self our healthier healthier self and and what does that look like and what does it feel like doing what are our behaviors that we're doing consistently throughout that process right and so but as I'm gonna ask you a series of questions that's kind of gonna build that okay so I'm just kind of curious what are you currently doing right now to support your health and well-being yeah so with my background and exercise and just passion for that I've had for years just a habit of doing almost daily exercise and so it's nothing insane but I always do about 25 30 minutes of something whether it be yoga weight lifting going out for a very slow run because I'm not very fast or like some sort of dance cardio type type workout so consistently doing that I'd also say consistently getting pretty good sleep like you know seven to eight eight and a half hours a night yeah and then I've had kind of like a slower season so a good amount of time to just spend time alone which is hard for me to do but I think really healthy stone do you want to tell me more about that that you said it's hard for you but healthy that's healthy yeah I think because I really enjoy being around people and I'm an extrovert that many times if I am going too much with that it fills me up typically but it takes me a little while to notice that I haven't had any time just to myself and because I am kind of people oriented sometimes I can in empathetic sometimes I can lose a little bit of well what do I think about that or what you know what are my needs in that moment or things like that so I can kind of get lost in others opinions and needs it's opposed to mine yeah so it sounds like by nature of being an extrovert and wanting to be around people in your normal busy daily life you kind of get lost in that and other people's needs and priorities and because it sounds like you're a giver too and that this this time of the year you found yourself having a little bit more time of being alone so it almost forced that time for you yes yeah absolutely and I recognize that I I still want a majority of people time but having that alone time and knowing that it's important I think makes me want to make sure I carve that out when I have busier seasons yeah that's really great to notice that yourself too right to see what you where you want to go with it yeah good okay so what elements of your life are you just feeling the best about right now hmm I love the job that I get to do so wellness coaching and then getting to teach a class I put Pepperdine as well so I think career-wise I'm super pleased and I feel grateful for that because I know that hasn't always been the case for me and isn't always the case for everybody that's wonderful I'm married to the best person that I know so that feels really like awesome he makes me laugh and challenges me and we just enjoy being active together and going on adventures together and stuff like that and I've just been really blessed I've moved around a lot and have been blessed with making really good friends in all those places so even though it's hard to live far away from these good friends I we still all try and keep up with each other and so I'm just really grateful for these like kind of powerhouse women that I get to be friends with that sounds like a really nice life yeah I love hearing that that's really really great thank you do you want to highlight maybe and let's specifically think about your health and just to be clear about health we're thinking about health in a very broad very holistic fashion right so sometimes what the fitness industry does is tell us that health is two things nutrition and physical activity already hearing you talk about things like your relationships and things like because it's really bigger picture right it's person so thinking about that can you tell me some success stories that you've had recently with your health oh let's see yeah I feel like a success story in the sense like kind of thinking about like the fitness industry how you've mentioned a lot of the stories at least I hear coming out of it are you have to go hard all the time with your your exercise for it to counts for it to matter and I just feel like I'm in like exercise has just become this like this is how I'm able to meet the rest of life's demands well and so I think a success story is just kind of over those years of X sighs just coming to a place of like even if I don't have a specific goal I'm pursuing just the fact that I'm doing it too as like a life sustainer sort of thing feels like really healthy because I know there will be times where I I do have a goal that I want to pursue and that can fluctuate but I think that right now it just feels like it's in this really life-giving space if that makes sense yeah I love that term life-giving there's something you're a really good relationship with physical activity right and they're in a good spot with that and that's that's really wonderful to hear what what do you think you look I want to get at some of your strengths that you um and I know you've probably all done some strength finders test they'll tell you that but just innately and thinking about who you are think what qualities are you just the most proud of about yourself hmm that's a good question I think meeting a lot of things with like a joyful attitude I think that's something that though you have to cultivate like I do think it also kind of comes a little more naturally to me and I think that having that positive attitude can really has really served me well but can also just help overcome a lot of challenges that life throws your way and so kind of figuring out like um is a very forleo that says everything is figure out Apple so like kind of I think it helps me cultivate that mindset sure I think just caring a lot about people is a strength I'm proud of just wanting the best for them wanting to be a part of them reaching that whether it's like family or coaching clients or students like or friends you know it's just I love like being witness to them reaching their full potential so I think just like really caring about other people's flourishing including myself but yeah yeah and that certainly aligns with what you said in the beginning - right of like kind of wanting to be around other people and and having a need to wanting to help okay so - the strengths I'm hearing from you so far kind of this this innate positive joyful attitude that that you know you might naturally have but also you kind of fox or not yourself right and that's kind of helped get through some things and which is really a great you know naturally they have have this wanting to help people and that being it seems like a common thread throughout all of the avenues of your life right professional can you think of any other major strengths that you think even think about this like think about what has gotten you through some things in the past you know yeah I would definitely say well I guess I don't know if it's like a strength or not but my faith for sure and they're just like that belief that I'm not alone and there's that higher bigger power that I can rely on so that's one and I think just I guess the part that I've played in making connections with friends and family and so then again kind of knowing that when I hit hard times that I have those people whether they live next to me or not that I can call on them and they'll be there for me so I think and I know it's a two-way street you know so that means that I have been there for them in the past and they know they can do the same so yeah that's really great who seemed to have a very good social network right strong social network around you that's what I'm hearing so far absolutely and that's incredibly important you know as you know just for our life but also for our goals and behaviors and why not so definitely so what right now thinking about your health and well-being what do you think is the most important thing to you right now today I guess like important in like like for a future or for um we can even do to say we could I see what you're saying meeting right now versus next week or yeah yeah how about we just think about it for both right like it could be like what's currently the most important but maybe what's on your brain for the future yeah yeah so I think currently something I've been thinking about me in the exercise is going well but the nutrition piece is another story and so I kind of want to end up with that similar kind of like good relationship with the food as I have with that exercise so I want that to be a little more balanced okay so to do that currently and then more future I think one of the reasons that exercise is so beneficial is that like I have scoliosis and so I I'm just very aware that now that I'm in my mid-thirties our bodies do you kind of grow older and degenerate and I want to be active as long as possible so I just don't I want to I don't want to be limited by that so I want to keep doing that exercise as much as possible so that I can slow that decline and then if you're going to take that same perspective of of age with nutrition how do you feel about that mm well I think the same thing I mean just even noticing mmm like in my folks who are who eat pretty decently well for not being necessarily really in this field or anything like that and just seeing how much vitality they have in their mid-60s and so wanting to have that so it also kind of ties to the future of wanting to do that but I think also presently I notice how much it affects my energy which of course like then affects how good of a job I can do how well I can connect with people it's all connected so so let's let's dive a little bit more into that so seem it sounds like physical activity that pieces you feel really good you have that strong relationship with it right now you see how it's connected to the future so you have that kind of motivator that exists there yeah I was like that motivator it's just nutrition but it also sound like you're not as um satisfied maybe with where you are on your relationship with with nutritions can you speak a little bit more to that yeah so I think I again have been blessed to feel like I hadn't had like a poor relationship with food or things like that and and very much a an intuitive eater anyway but I also am a big celebrator I love I mean this could be like where the strengths kind of goes wrong like the joyfulness can also be like everything is a celebration or should be and so I smooth is a part of that and drinks are a part of that and so I think what I'd like to see is obviously not eliminating that because I think that your quality of life is also wrapped up in that but maybe not being in such a like everything's a celebration every and gold a feeling and it's not necessarily every single day but most days and kind of toning that down to where there's like there are special times and special occasions and times to bring celebration in but my eating doesn't reflect that every day is Thanksgiving sure yeah I understand that okay so can you think of a recent example to where you maybe thought back I thought oh yeah that wasn't a celebration or I should have I wish I would have done something different mmm yeah yeah I think that's great question um yeah I think even just like within the past couple of weeks like um treating dinner time where my husband and his brother lives with us now and so like where all three of us are at home which actually happens every night for dündar I'm thinking like oh I should make cookies for us and I should also make sure that we've got some you know spiced wine because it's the Christmas season and so doing that where maybe one of those things would have been fine or just recognizing like hey let's save that for for instance last night we made it a point to celebrate Christmas together because our brother-in-law is gonna leave tomorrow and so like he opened our gift and you know that would have been more like hey this makes sense celebration time whereas just a random night of the week isn't and again that can happen sometimes why do you think you you've been doing that recently mmm good question I think it feels like a way that I can contribute because I do know that I bring the joy and I value celebration so it's kind of like this is what I contribute to our little family and I also know my husband's been working so hard that and this isn't anything he's asked for but it's always think I'm like oh let me make it take a load off of you even when I can't take any work off of you you know so not as well and it's interesting going back to this is the beginning of like describing yourself right and like what the things that who you are is that Giver mm-hmm wanting to do that it really ties in to to this piece of seeing your husband and in maybe a stressful time of year and wanting to help him out right and you're using your words taking a load off right by doing this is there any other reason you think that you think you've been doing this recently so I know it's a way to contribute maybe helping your your husband and your little family there but any other reasons yeah I think honestly again cuz I'm in a season of being in so much alone time I think it's like something to do so like making cookies or making this um these fun holiday drinks or things like that it's almost like it it mm I don't know if distractions the right word but maybe of like oh well this is something I can do and I know it will contribute to future time that I spend with people yeah absolutely I really appreciate you digging in a little bit to that because I think that's always those are those moments where we just kind of do things we don't stop and think about like why am I doing this right so I think that in itself is probably pretty beneficial that process so it sounds like it and I want to make sure this is clear so for any little clarity it sounds like moving forward as far as your well vision maybe is the most the biggest piece of where you want it what you might want to change is that I would agree yeah okay so what do you think is the driving force behind wanting to change right now hmm honestly coaching and going through the certification process they do a really good job of reminding you that you should walk the talk and so I think I know that but it's good to be reminded and I think it becomes more pressing when it's I'm about to go after certification and I'm currently seeing some clients and I learned from the clients too when they're pursuing goals and it kind of inspires me to do stuff to always learning yeah okay so the driving force is that you're kind of going through the certification process and you're in it right you have the clients you're kind of reminding you as well but then also your certification the certifying body is telling you hey you got a watch a talk and hmm so reminder so it's kind of fresh on the brain yeah exactly okay now kind of digging a little bit deeper to this vision what are the most important elements to your vision so and I always like to think of this if you're a visual person of if it's a year from now what is it what does it look like take me a picture what does it feel like what are you doing you know yeah I think the exercise is similar like near-daily something that just feels good in my body I think that a majority of the time I'm eating foods of fuel my body for energy with you know the the minority of the time having those celebrating foods and having like a better balance of that mm-hmm I think because of that then I would just feel really really energized my skin would be clear I would feel strong and able to be really present whoever I'm talking with whether it be a coaching client or a student or threader family you'd be more present because of what you said earlier right of having more energy right okay and not like that kind of brain fog that can come with certain foods and drinks and stuff so you feel that connection between the food and your energy levels and I call that definitely so one question I have is is this something that you you typically experience because you use the word seasonal is this something it is truly a seasonal feeling meaning this time of the holiday season relatively new thing for this particular season of your life that's a great question and that I'm glad you asked because if you think of yes so it hasn't just been this particular holiday season it's been like since we moved to California because we've had such a steady stream of guests coming to visit us and so of course you know as as I would want to if I were them they want to go out and experience things and so we try and do that with them too so a lot more eating out then I'm typically used to which kind of keeps me in that like holiday celebration zone you know so then when I'm just home it's like well I want to make this a celebration too I haven't been able to kind of just have normal Y for long huh mm-hmm that makes sense 100% yeah it sounds like it's like this eternal vacation vacation that you're totally it's kind of exhausting but awesome yeah I can hear that from you absolutely okay so I think that's a good clarity piece right to kind of know and understand so it seems like this has been going on for the last what two years ish right so so now it's become more of a normal behavior that you're trying to then figure out how to maybe potentially change a little right yep okay so now let's let's think about maybe some experiences with this vision so again this vision mean almost daily your your your focusing on I know you said you eat primarily healthy right but it's no longer this normal daily thing of celebration right you feel good and what you're putting in your body you're really energy energized and you're not having that fog can you tell me maybe some of your recent experiences or most recent experiences of feeling that way with food yeah I think one was when I was at Colorado State and crazy enough leading adult fitness and which is probably one of the most insane times of life I think but in and so I guess it wasn't a great situation because I wasn't like cooking as much as I do now so that piece has gotten much better but it was great because even though I was eating on the run a lot it was all stuff that just felt really good in my body and I think energized me for that kind of a you know crazy job and teaching schedule and what kind of so if I just want to clarify so it was mostly because you're still eating relatively healthy now we see the absence of those celebratory meals and snacks and treats is that yep mm-hmm why do you think that that time in particular you weren't having those celebratory meals and snacks and things like that hmm maybe I didn't have time yeah because I know I did it some but not not a ton maybe you know I definitely had like my fill of people like it was the nature of that job my husband I were dating about to get engaged and married so we have spent a lot of time together and still had a lot of my grad school friends in town so I think I was just like really full in that way if that makes sense yeah I think that's a good tie right is noticing that not only was it maybe just literally not having the time to do it but the tie to the fact that you've already were spending all this time with people that you loved and cared for and so maybe I need to have those celebratory meals because it was happening innately without that right yes it's almost like it felt like just the connection with people felt like the celebration so I didn't necessarily need anything else to make a celebration out of it so we would you say that currently a lot of the connection that you have with people you maybe feel that you need to happen for something you for some reason you need to celebrate mm-hmm it's a good question I think though I have an awesome social network who doesn't live here I'm still working on creating one here having that friend time face-to-face is kind of what I'm missing out on I'm getting it it's like the slow turn of building those relationships but it's not to the place of like oh these are best friends for life yeah so then it feels like those moments you really have to make special yeah I appreciate you sharing that too it sounds like you have a thinking about that past experience really kind of maybe highlighted some of that yeah and I never thought about it that way it's okay so now let's think about your strengths right that's why I always loved if we're think about your strengths what strengths do you think you can draw on right now to help you from where you will learn at home to where you want to be so if you can imagine and noting very clearly that your gap what we call about this gap right you're good where you are now to where you want to be is very small so I just I want a picture right not to diminish it yeah and it's still very very important but what do you think what strikes you have can get you to that that point I definitely think I do have a strength of connecting with people and so I think that I can make those relationships here I think it just takes um kind of reminding myself about hey you've done this in the past I've moved a lot so recognizing that and even recognizing I had a friend tell me recently that who moves a lot that she has learned that each place is different and so you can't go into it thinking like oh it's gonna be exactly the same as this last place because as different people different things to do you know so I think recognizing to you that these are different people is a different place but I can still use my strengths of connecting to others and then I also from the food Avenue I don't know if it's enough to say like that will trickle down to the food sure thanks for that I mean I strength is that I I know I've kind of done the work to know what energizes my body so I know what kinds of foods I should be putting into it if I want to feel the most energized okay what what type of foods how is it different from what you're currently doing with those celebratory meals to worry maybe those foods that you have in your brain that are energizing foods mmm yeah I think like seeing because I always want something sweet at the end of the day so I think finding more of like the fruits and things of that nature that are sweet instead of you know like the cookies and the M&M so almost like replacing some of the sweet things with things that also can't even though they have sugar that have other benefits to them okay so not completely removing the behavior here which i think is smart but replacing it with you got it okay I mean I love that because you're kind of going down a little bit dig deeper and we'll get there it's great okay so sounds like a strength of connecting people can can help just because you know you can do that and you're kind of fostering some of those relationships right now and talking to other friends who've done it in the past and moved to learn a lot just I think maybe being being open and kind to yourself and it might take a bit longer it might be different than in the past right and but then also stuff like that might not necessarily you don't necessarily see that linked to the nutrition so but then you so you want to kind of set some more specific things with the nutrition right I think so and I think maybe it's because I know I said I couldn't see that link but I I think I do from questions you're asking but I think it feels slower to me that I want the descrition change to be good you never know how long it'll take to make like those really close friendships yes what are you currently doing to build those so we have a church that we go to you and it's nice and small one so it's easier to meet people because they know you're new and then with that church I had like a few gals that I get to meet with weekly and it's nice because we're all in different life stages so kind of getting to know them and then there's also kind of like a larger group that I meet with almost weekly like guys and gals from that group as well oh great okay and then there are a couple of gals that I met at a free Lululemon workout class yeah so just trying to get together with them when I can love it so I eat people who have shared interests and that says you write yes uh-huh you're right those processes those can take some time to cool those relationships but I'm glad you can see the link between that and n even the nutrition right your your big vision okay so thinking about your well vision really being having this what sounds like is this balanced and good relationship with physical activity nutrition right but it sounds like the physical activity is there really the focus is gonna be I starts behavior change on nutrition and it sounds like you have some you identify your strengths or how relates to that what what support systems do you think you have around you that can help you with that and be something as simple as your relationships around you but it also could be things in your environments you know resources that you have around you kind of think about big picture yeah I definitely think the food that we bring into the house and I because it's been such a busy season for my husband and the primary grocery shopper I control that okay so I recognize that if it's not in the house it's not a problem but if it is and I'm the one who brought it in then most likely I'm gonna be the one who eats it and my husband and brother-in-law to potentially but for sure me so earlier you mentioned the going out with friends because friends are often like coming and visiting and so everything seems like a so-so sounded like eating out was a piece of that would you like cakes or is it primarily just the foods that you're buying and bringing into the house we just haven't had a guest here in a couple of months and so I think that's maybe a little more on my brain but I know they're coming and so yeah the eating out piece is is definitely a piece of that to you like I'd love to you know have the time for oh I'm gonna eat something to try something new or whatever but also if I'm recognizing we're having a lot of people choosing things that will fuel me better rather their be celebratory only is it okay do you mind if I highlight something yeah absolutely okay so I love that you brought up the fact that you're the primary grocery shopper right and that you're so you kind of control what's bringing into the house which certainly that is like a good environmental piece right but the first thing you brought up was a support structure that's based within you so I would love to explore some support structures that don't yeah maybe things around you yeah absolutely so definitely my husband is probably one of the most self disciplined people I know since he's a runner and so all it would take would be to say hey I would like you to kind of help keep me accountable give me some ideas he's also very creative so he's a really good resource and wants to see me flourish and feel my best so he's like the immediate one because he lives with me but I also you know have friends in in this field who I can reach out to you as well and just say hey I love ideas I love what works for you guys what even if you checked in with me like all sorts of accountability I think yeah awesome so your husband is a great resource cuz he lives in there he wants the best for you he's also very self disciplined right and has a health book in us right it also sounds like you have some of the network's as far as friends but not who can kind of help you maybe if you have questions about things but also just keep you accountable then things like that right definitely have you had any these conversations about this with friends family or even your husband a little but not much I I'd say not really with friends yet um and a little with even kind of noticing like the amount of caffeine I intake so my husband and I kind of working on transitioning to some decaf coffee and stuff like that so you've had some nutrition related conversation with your husband Kathy tell me a little bit more about that yeah so I think both of us just kind of realize that we've gotten to the point of of having too much and you know a little is fine but I think just recognizing that not only is it daily but it's a lot daily for both of us what it's done is it's kind of been pretty funny because he'll wake up in the morning and make the coffee and not tell me what it is I was just so tired all decaf yeah yeah and so that might not be like the best route to go maybe a half-caf would be better but it's been like a pretty funny challenge like for both of us I'm like will she be able to tell yeah and then I think me realizing oh it actually makes a difference if it is more of a sign of like this is something we should change up a little bit yeah how are you even feeling with that well we did that for a while and then hit like a really busy season so it's been hurting again so okay yeah back to it yeah exactly okay um is that something that you might want to explore later when we go into some changes nutritionally and things like yeah okay so if we're thinking about our well your ball vision and and where you want to be and how you want to feel with nutrition what do you think might be some challenges that might get your way mm-hmm yeah I think just the well the fact that I like almost all food but so yeah I think that's a challenge ain't a good thing probably but sure I think because of the connection piece if others are like if my husband or brother-in-law decides like oh I'm gonna open up a beer and I had already previously decided I wasn't it's really hard for me to continue with that decision because it feels like a celebration that I don't know and so then because of that when we do have guests and we go out especially if it's like a new place I haven't gone to you it's kind of more fun to try other things so again I think that like connection and celebration two sides of the coin yeah and can hinder my goals a little bit to you yeah yeah I think that's a really good honest evaluation of some of the challenges that might come up right do you see a world where you can still engage in these connections and these moments with people while at the same time having doing less of the the sweets and the you know the what you were calling unhealthy quote unquote unhealthy foods on a frequent basis do you think they can coincide I do I think it just takes a little more intention and because I've done it before where I've chosen like I I can think of some times where I've gone out to eat and I've chosen what felt what I knew would feel better energy wise in my body and I haven't felt like I missed out and I also can if I can make that connection more often in my brain of like if I have energy I can actually connect with people better and be present with them you know recognizing that hey food can be a connection and the fun you know foods and stuff like that can be a connection but it can also detract from connection because I feel a large Accor I don't feel like I can get present as I otherwise could I think that's incredibly important connections that were too much about that you just talking those two things and it's nice that you can think back to a time where you have done that and and gone out and still were able to have those moments with people and connect with them and have that celebrate right but these choose the choices for food that made you feel more energized so that you could have more of that connection right absolutely any other challenges that you can think about that might come up that you anticipate um I mean the holidays so we'll be traveling for that and so the potential of I think we'll be able to purchase a lot of our own groceries and stuff just because we'll be staying with my brother and there he just had a new baby so we're gonna be kind of on our own in that sense but yeah I mean any time with traveling plus holiday I think we'll make make it at least for this next couple of weeks a little more difficult I think that's completely understandable right and we all can kind of understand the unique uniqueness of the holiday season that does write to how we feel and our behaviors and what we're around and our advice right all of that and so I think that's that's important to kind of consider as you're as you're thinking about the changes that you potentially want to make right so what I would love to do is let's let's kind of summarize and reflect on the vision and then if it's okay with you I'm gonna ask that you restate that for yourself and kind of commit to that and then what we'll do from there is we're gonna go into some specific kind of big picture 3-month goals and then become one or two men depending on what you need and want I'm smaller kind of weekly goals kind of support my vision so what I'm hearing from you for your vision is that you know big picture what you want to feel is energized and that because you're energized you're able to connect those ones those loved ones around you and that you're able to still have those moments of celebration but in those moments not really compromised maybe the food choices that you're making so that you can't continue to have that connection it's um yeah okay and I know that sounds silly but would you mind kind of receding in your own words maybe No so my vision is to have energy to make good connections with people and to have not only my exercise but my food choices and nutrition choices support the ability to be present and make those connections I love it I'm just typing away here look great I really like your your choice of words how do you feel about committing to this I feel good I think it's something I've been thinking about but it's nice to talk about it and kind of see the line between some of these things yeah absolutely um so let's let's kind of dig into now no having this as our ultimate vision right let's dive into this kind of 3-month goal oh the the nature of setting these goals is to really help you because if we word it's just a focus on the vision they sometimes I can be just like okay what's next right yeah the idea behind these three-month goals is that you have maybe a slightly smaller but still bigger picture of where you want to be and then from there we're gonna build these smaller weekly goals that can be a nice check-in point for you to know how to get to those 3-month goals yeah that make sense okay so what are some actions and you come described a few right but what are some actions that you think you could take behavioural changes to help support your while vision yeah I definitely linked the coffee piece so transitioning to decaf more often for sure okay I think it's a good question I think yeah even having that conversation more with my husband and possibly like a friend or two of yeah of hey I'm trying to kind of tweak this a little bit what would that look like and and then I yeah I don't know if it would be helpful this is just a thought of like kind of looking ahead and seeing the times that are more celebratory and knowing that hey I've got those to look forward to you so then I know like okay but for these days I'm going to fuel my body well you know so just to clarify thinking ahead into the future and and having a good understanding of those events that you really won't want us ready yeah right so that you don't um celebrate on the other day so that maybe aren't what you think our celebration got it exactly she you want to value or when you want to kind of focus in on the celebrations okay I think almost kind of calendar or something no no basically you're like okay what's coming up where it's gonna be like oh this is fun and I want to enjoy whatever food and drink and stuff like that or I want to make it for that or you know sure okay that definitely makes sense any other actions you think for that that will help with your vision I think finding a way to remind myself that that I really do value that connection with people and that might so my energy is important because I again I know who that but it's so like far tucked away in my brain that I don't remember it in the moment I think that can be hard right too because you get it but then in that moment when everything's happening it can be hard to remember that sure definitely understand that okay okay so it sounds like you have a few different actions here for this three-month goal so transitioning into decaf more often having this conversation with your husband and friends thinking through the future of when you really want to celebrate things like one of the big things that are gonna happen mm-hmm can be finding a way to remember how important that energy is to you actually yes okay so let's if you one of the things that happens with these 3-month goals is and even any kind of goals it's usually a good idea to have a few that are really solid and you feel comfortable about um where you're concentrating on those and able to kind of drive forward with your vision with those specific goals so thinking know about your 3-month goal what would be a few that you really are connected to and you think might really help you pursue your vision yeah I think the coffee so making that transition or at least like a more consistent transition less caffeine yes yeah and any other ones for their three-month goal I think that last one of just finding a way to remind myself of what my actual value is okay in that wanting to connect with people let's let's if you're okay with that take these and try to make them a little bit more tailored and specific so um I'm sure you've heard of the acronym smart goals before okay so we're gonna set some SMART goals right now if you wouldn't mind kind of trying to take each one of those the coffee and then remembering how energy can help with your connection eating both of those that kind of thinking through a way to make them smart goals okay so with the coffee remembering that this is your 3-month goal record yeah time frame is bigger for this one okay so I think yeah I think I don't know what do you suggest that's the interesting question so what do you what have you set any goals in the past about coffee I have it not like not like specifically okay how about have you set any goals specifically or how about this do you know anything about what you would like how much caffeine you'd like to take in every day yeah good question um I think ideally I think like even longer term picture I'd love to transition to drinking more tea than coffee but that's like I feel like and so I think like 3-month goals then I'd love to say like mmm half the time I'm drinking decaf okay so there doesn't sound like there's a milligram amount of being that you're like trying to focus in on currently what you're currently doing and then changing that right exactly yeah okay so you said drinking half you know yeah so I guess like replacing half of what I'm currently drinking with Zika could you be a little bit more specific as far as what that looks like what is half a great question yeah I think so I I think maybe even having like a time of day could be really helpful because I kind of drink coffee throughout the day well until like about I don't know late afternoon and so I think almost that by let's say noon I've it's no more caffeine it's if I'm going to drink something it's decaf okay okay so no it sounds like by 12 p.m. if you're going to drink any drinking liquids it's any caffeine right so what does the before 12 look like what's an like a for you an okay amount how many cups of coffee mm-hmm I think what I'm currently doing is probably about two cups of coffee at home and then I usually go to a coffee shop to to work probably like three cups of coffee so in a three-month period what would be if I'm understanding this correctly is that before 12 p.m. kind of having three cups of coffee in that time period and then after 12 p.m. if you're going to have any kind of other liquids making sure there's no cap as I understand yeah mm-hmm how does that whole feel to you it feels good it feels like doable and I can already sense like what I'll want to keep doing in the future but I think that's a good thing right yeah absolutely yeah I think that's good to kind of know where you want to go from here and then what we're gonna do next is kind of think through what you'll do smaller to get to that for yes yeah and it feels doable which is good instead of like a big overhaul of my life that's important right we know that's working with goal setting so I appreciate that okay so now let's if you're okay with that let's go on and move to this the second goal which it might seem a little bit more abstract to you based on how you were saying it it's like finding a way right yeah I'd yourself of the actual value of this like the energy will help you with connection yeah what would be three months what would be a goal you want to meet for that I think well I can I can see because again with holiday time it's gonna be a lot of family that I want to connect with mm-hmm and so just recognizing that I guess in three months I want to look back and feel like I had the energy I did what I could to make myself available for those connections and really present during that time I don't know if I answered the question at all and this is these kind of goals are really hard to make into SMART goals you know the nature of what you're talking about by still important to kind of be as specific and measurable as possible because it's good to think through that so when you say you want to look back and feel like you could be available on present during those times how will you quantify that mm-hmm yeah I think feeling like I'm mature I know this can be a difficult question to answer so feel free take some time to think about I think feeling as though during the days I've eaten like Ferb breakfast lunch any snacking in between I've really eaten things that fuel my body because then that fuels me for the day of being with family and then if I do eat some celebratory things it's more in the evening like sure before going to bed because that's so I still get both you know the celebration but I haven't taken away from the connection and the energy to have that connection with my family but then I also majority of the time I'm still eating food that fuels me well and this sounds like a specific thing during the holiday season right Orton because after the holiday season since it's a three month thing you're gonna be pushing into February so I wonder if that will look a little different I think it will for sure I think we're planning on probably having a guest or two in January February so I kind of the same thing for all the time that they're here but that's still not very many days but yeah I think it's almost like a nice rule of thumb for like the holidays or having people here mm-hmm when I'm maybe not cooking at home all the time or like that yeah but for the rest of the so can I ask a clarifying question absolutely oh it sounds like in three months you want to look back and feel that you did everything that you could and what that looks like is that during the days so basically breakfast until dinner or whatever you are you're eating the foods that fuel you that you know are gonna help you make those you know energized connections right and the evenings that's where you're gonna know how you allow yourself some grace and be able to connect with family and via food and treats and things like that is this a daily thing that you feel comfortable doing is this a you know a few times a week thing or just you understand what I'm saying is it every day do you be comfortable with that those behaviors um I feel like that's already kind of what I'm doing in my date in my normal daily life and so I think I want to tweak that even though they further whereas maybe not every night am I having something that's like a sweet or a drink or something you know like having one or the other both do you have a number in mind that you can I'd say I don't know like probably like three nights a week seems like plenty for me to have where it's like the more celebratory type of okay foods or drinks great so in three months you'll be during the days eating foods that are gonna energize you and help connect you and then three times a week you're going to embrace the fun you know maybe not as normal foods for you to eat so that you can have those moments of celebration with your family I understand that okay how does that feel good yeah okay does it feel doable it does feel doable it feels like it'll stretch me but I think that's good you know that but I don't feel like I'm restricting myself if that makes sense what do you think are some of the advantages to to these goals live them out would be some advantages yeah I think advantages with the coffee I can already tell that like the amount of caffeine I'm taking in is kind of not feeling good in my body like the shaky and the like hard others and stuff and so recognizing that if I want this body long-term this is a clear thing that I need to focus on and even just from a financial standpoint when I go to coffee shops buying tea is a lot cheaper so if I can like work my way towards that that would be great with with the other one um I think just being able to connect with people I don't get to see with see very often like my family during the holidays or these friends that are planning on visiting so I want to just like enjoy and soak up all that time and I think too since we are seeing my family for the holidays I want to be kind of a good leader in that for my husband as well so to make sure like you know he feels included but also that he can do the things that fill him up too so I think that takes just that intentionality for me which takes energy and meaning be a good leader do you mean be a good leader by making sure this is something that you're doing daily or being a good leader and that you're fostering those connected just with him and yeah being a good leader that I'm fostering the connections with him as well and I think because it is my family and he needs a lone time that it will even though he can tell me when he does need it I think it actually works better if I say hey by the way I get out of here now this is a good time and so recognizing that mm-hmm takes me because I'm not an introvert takes me a lot more energy and concentration I guess in the moment to be like oh this is a good time doing anything like really huge and mind-blowing with the family ah if you want to take some time away I hate that I don't know yeah so it's me it sounds like this benefit of so you describe the advantage for yourself of making the change of only you know kind of having the the celebratory meals three times a week as you had as a connection with others where the know how do i express it's the limiting it to three times a week it seemed like there was more of a connection to your husband so what what is an advantage stream mmm to limiting it to three times a week yeah I think oh sorry no I said just versus everyday like what's the bit three times a week versus everyday yeah so oh wait is this for the coffee piece or for them the food yes okay I think yeah for me I have the energy to devote to work that I want to to have the clarity of mind that because we need some creativity in our work and for teaching so to be able to to put everything I can into the work that I wanted to you and kind of view it at the caliber that I want to use I think yeah just feeling good in my body in the sense of like I'm treating it with the care it deserves because it's been a good body you know and so to sustain it and so it's almost I see it as a way of loving myself well you know not only doing the exercise that feels good but fueling it well I love that you said that I think that's a really great perspective thanks and motivator and reason to do things right yeah so you've enlisted some advantages what do you think are some disadvantages manages of states three months from now and it just doesn't happen what's happening mm-hmm disadvantages of these not happening mm-hm yeah I think just sheer amount of caffeine is just not cool and so I think that would probably just continue to get worse and worse in terms of kind of how it affects my body or you've been feeling you know like if I don't have it kind of that almost addictive quality sure he's and not wanting to be addicted to anything you know sure so that part and I think with a food I think just disadvantage would be I'm feeling like I'm not being able to bring my full self to everything okay I think that's really great and I think is a really good to start from and I think from here if you're okay with it we can kind of go into more of the specific weekly goals I can kind of support those three-month goals is that that sounds great okay so which one would you like to start with let's do the coffee okay so what do you think could be a few weekly goals to help you support that free month goal yeah I think I think talking with my husband again about incorporating the decaf again and then buying some more so we have it in those yeah I'm trying to think cuz I wanted to kind of take the caffeine by noon so maybe finding whether I'm either not at the coffee shop or I order like a tea that's far less decaf if I'm at the coffee shop in the afternoon morning so finding a replacement beverage yeah in the afternoon okay so um do you want to stick with these three you think as kind of these weekly goals yeah okay can can we go back and make them SMART goals so let's start with the one about you talking to your husband yeah um I mean I can do that because he'll probably ask me about this I can do that as early as this evening and just you know it's something he wants to do to you so I don't foresee that being like a hard conversation I mean yeah I think and that's part of the goal setting right I was making sure that we're setting goals that are attainable as well hey so okay so you're gonna talk to your husband today about incorporating more decaf but it made clear that you're also gonna talk to him about your your 3-month goal yeah okay um how about the buying more decaf in the house how can you make that a SMART goal yeah I think the next time I go to the store which will probably be my guess is tomorrow you just add that to the grocery list how much decaf are you going to buy mm-hmm one of the I guess I don't know how many but just a regular like coffee package of AB decaf okay because you've had it in the house before right if yes yes you just have run out yeah okay and we bought more caffeine so maybe if this is a weekly goal that's a nice thing to have right yes mm-hmm and then lastly with the replacement beverage how can you make that into a smart goal yeah I think I think it will help to tell my husband about that one you okay there's again as I said before he's a really good resource to help with like health things and then yeah I think almost making it a habit to check what time I'm leaving the house to go to the coffee shop like okay if it's noon or after now I know what I'm going to buy so checking the time before you ordered their beverage yeah I understand okay the next time you're at the coffee shop check and see what time it is time before ordering yeah um and order a less caffeinated mm-hmm have you thought through some of what those might look like I know you mentioned tea but that's about all I've gone through because I know that the coffee shop I go to they have their tea actually sitting right out front in front of the cash register so I can see it so I know they have that option my guess is they probably have a decaf coffee option but I think I would like the tea option better if I'm going out do you mind if I ask a question about that specifically have you asked them how much caffeine isn't that tea no I haven't that's a good question maybe right I mean especially to see how much is in there yeah absolutely you see if it's even like is this making a dent okay so could you maybe add that to your cold ah absolutely didn't okay so the next time you're at the coffee shop you'll check time of ordering and order a less caffeinated beverage I asking yes okay um okay great and I want to be mindful of time we have a few minutes left so it sounds like we have some really nice weekly goals for the caffeine do you want to move on to weekly goals for the kind of food choices sure right do you think would be good supportive weekly goals for your three months goal let's see yeah I think again telling my husband what my plan is when we're traveling in terms of you know hey I I want to eat just things that give me energy until dinnertime and after and then I mean I could still eat things that give me energy but yeah and when do you want to do that bye tell him I'll probably probably tonight too is again I think I'll recap a lot of our conversation with him okay yeah so that's a that's a nice kind of weekly goal to help with that is there anyone else you would like to have that conversation with or also you think you could do to support that goal yeah my friend Michelle who also is Picon house that she loves talking about this stuff so I think she'd actually welcomed the conversation which is fun and when will you talk to her about that um I will probably talk to her I say by tomorrow at the latest okay I really appreciate you taking the time to add the detail to this I think it's always helpful never no not that big picture how are you feeling about these smaller goals I feel good I feel excited because again these are kind of some things that I've been mulling around so it'll be nice to actually do something and I feel like they're doable again they're not anything crazy but you still have to take a stuff to do it so sure well there's one last thing I want to do before we kind of wrap up today and I always like doing this with clients and I think it helps sometimes quantify and put it into perspective so have you ever used a confidence ruler like a 1 to 10 confidence ruler not for myself okay so essentially it's okay that I explain with that is absolutely okay so essentially what we do here is that we kind of think about each of our goals and we think okay if 10 is I am 100% confident that I will do this every week 1 is there's no confidence there's no way I'm doing this are you kind of on that threshold so maybe you could pick one of your kind of the caffeine goals that you think is most prevalent to yourself or what you think is the most important that you want to focus on yeah I think the talking to my husband about mm-hmm kind of switching it up here in the home okay yeah oh and in the yeah yeah 1 to 10 scale 99 feel good about that because you feel so strong about that do you mind if I ask the same question about buying decaf and have pudding good that's great again I'd say a9 just because I feel ready to do it I think he'll be on board so okay that's good I mean it sounds like that's a nice one because you also have the support of him yeah definitely how about finding that replacement beverage when you go to the coffee shop and I feel a little lower know what they have and I this will probably be the first time I've ever ordered a decaf drink I'd say 7 oh no ok 7 out of 10 now what do you think why do you think it's not maybe like a 5 y 7 I feel pretty confident they'll have something because my mom orders decaf any time we're together and every coffee shop has happened with something ok so even though I haven't ever checked that specifically at this coffee shop my guess is they'll have something that is lower in caffeine wonderful so through vicarious experience this with your mom you know that it exists and it can happen you just have yourself right yeah so that explains kind of how you feel 7 out of 10 yeah let's do the same thing with your your weekly goals for food so on that 1 to 10 confidence kind of scale how do you feel about talking to your husband about the food piece of it tonight I'd say I'd say probably like an 8.5 um so why do you point 5 I think that the width in comparison to the first thing I'm talking about that's already been something we've kind of tried out he's like he already is on board and understands and I think this one I'll have to do a little more explaining and and stuff like that and so I think it'll just take a little more time ok yeah sounds like it's doable it's just a little bit more effort correct yeah ok and then how about talking to your friends about your plans for food when you travel mm I'd say good night ok strong yeah okay so before we move to the wrap-up um if you're ok with it I would love for you and I'm gonna I'm gonna send a follow-up email with this information but I would love for you to just kind of restate some of your goals is that ok that you could do that mm-hmm so for the caffeine go I'm going to talk to my husband tonight about wanting to incorporate more decaf here at home and then probably the latest tomorrow go to the grocery store and actually buy that decaf to have at home and then this week if I am going to the coffee shop I'll check what time I'm going in there and if it's afternoon then I'll ask about like a less caffeinated option I can order awesome there's that one and then the other talking to my husband about my eating goals for the holidays tonight as well and then talking to you friend Rochelle about that again I think probably by latest tomorrow - so I got some stuff in the next few days yeah but it sounds like they're doable right and I you know I appreciate so much about user you do you have this positive spirit and clearly guides you you know and in in your life and including things like this and your I think your true and Nate desires who want to connect with people is a really guiding light for all of this because it seems like it's the key piece right agreed yeah and I think that's really really great I think that's gonna help you achieve these goals you know if you kind of always can remember that that big picture right thanks Kelly yeah yeah well let's go ahead and start closing this session I really just appreciate you in your time I know today was a little longer you know just a reminder this is not how always will be your first session it's you know so important to come and dig a little
