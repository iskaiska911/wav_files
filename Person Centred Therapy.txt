okay max I understand that you have some concerns that you'd like to discuss today so whenever you're ready I'm happy for you to voice whatever it is that you'd like to talk about yeah well I suppose the bottom line is and I'm having some difficulties in my relationship with my wife and I very uncertain about actually being here and it's been embarrassing talking about these things for the stranger yeah so you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable discussing such personal information we've been outside yes it is I'm a bit awkward brought up us solve your problems yourself and your diet outside the family you don't take the promise to strangers and I would literally do but also I realize now that given the depth of the problem that I also need to get it another perspective on things okay all right I guess some what I generally say to people when they first come along is that it's not uncommon to feel quite uncomfortable talking to an outsider about such personal information and even though I can't predict exactly how you're going to feel and how things will go for you today I do know that in the past a lot of other people have have actually felt quite uncomfortable to begin with that as they've been able to talk and get things off their chest they actually feel quite relieved so you might find that that as we spend more time together that you're more comfortable in this environment well I hope it works out that one yeah yeah I'll see how we go well it was a friend of mine had been involved in counselling pre-rounding suggested that this is what I I should have temper do anyway yeah okay okay and you're saying before as well but but normally you like to solve things yourself and work things out yourself and I think it's quite a balanced perspective to to be looking at how you're going to resolve things yourself and also to get an outside perspective as well so I can see lots of benefit that can come from from that chilled approach well I haven't succeeded in doing it by myself so yeah that's worth a go yeah so perhaps we can we can shed some light on on some helpful approaches for you okay I guess to help me understand your situation it would be helpful if you could talk a little bit about what's been going on for you and what's brought you along well suppose things have just deteriorated in relationship with my wife Angelina we'd be very live in years in the Army got two kitties Johnny's nan and Jackie here soon and she's very busy in a job and she's always better that's plays a bit of a control freak she likes things to be just so and occasionally she would what I would call it lose the plot and she'd yell at Lee and abuse me but in the past that was never a problem because we could sit down and talk about it and she'd recognize that she probably got over the top on but lately it's really just gotten out of hand and it's it's she's not controlling her and got a temper and it it really concerns me there because I think it's starting to affect the kids right okay so it sounds like to begin with she might often become quite angry but she would settle down and you could resolve things but of late it's become a lot more volatile and she's become more explosive and and you're really concerned about the impact on yourself and the children yeah I mean the kids are younger I mean John John he's a boy and he seems to be handling things okay but you always uncertain as to really how things affecting him Jacky's jack is 87 as I said and she's a lot more sensitive and I just she's not really healed at least to go home and literally starting to put a lot of extra concern delay yeah okay so it sounds like if you've got a lot of concerns about both the kids and John's probably handling it okay outwardly even though obviously he's feeling it but Jackie you're particularly concerned about is quite delicate and you're worried about that impact and all of you are walking around on eggshells at the moment just waiting for some kind of explosion to happen that sounds right well I'm concerned about the kids not concerned about the marriage it's important to me to do what you can to keep things together because that's it's better for the kids but if I have to single out one major concern it would be probably for Jackie okay has been a few insolence likely where the kids have been expired
