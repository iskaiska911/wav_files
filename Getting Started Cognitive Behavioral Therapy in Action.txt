now one thing that's what we might do to get an example of one of these situations in which you get really anxious and try to see if we can understand more about how you think and how you feel when you're in the middle of one of those situation so can you think of an example of something to happen recently yeah my daughter has been she's actually been sick and so she had fever yesterday and they started her on an antibiotic and I had to go pick it up from the drugstore and that's like I don't usually go there it's hard to get there like it's not right in the neighborhood so any expressways or bridges to get there not expressways but it's busy it's busier in addressing I'm also in another major six one four lanes yeah so it just it's not some place I usually would go and if I was going to go usually I would either have her go with me or my husband go with me but she was sick and he was at work and so to try to understand what goes through your mind let's try to take you back and now you know that the prescriptions there and your daughter is sick and I guess you don't want to ask her to drive over there I sorted yeah probably not the wisest idea so you're thinking about doing the drive and what's going through your mind what are the thoughts that are turning inside I'm just you know I'm sort of thinking about going there and I'm already starting to think well you know what what if you know what if what if I'm driving and somebody crashes into me what if I'm driving and I can't do it you know what if I just have to stop because I can't do it anymore and you know it was raining and I'm sort of like I've got this picture of myself like out in the middle of the road and you know a picture look like you're on the middle of the road and branded and it's dark and my you know what you know my shoes are gone I'm just like it's like it would be a million miles to get back home pretty miserable yeah yeah please Gary Oh terribly yeah and um I just it's so hard to get there and Kate as you as you put yourself back into that situation and have those thoughts going through your mind what kinds of feelings go along with it yeah what I mean things are inside like my article anxiety physical things are going on well fear and anxiety and I just feel really shaky and I feel really like light-headed and dizzy and I just don't feel like I can breathe very well and I feel like I'm going to like fall over it's just a panic attack now you told me about having some pain I've had worse ones but it's getting there not quite to a panic yeah you know it's brewing yeah okay yeah it feels like it might yeah yeah well I think we might do to try to to move things along toward getting a plan of attack on this okay to actually sketch this out okay and and then see if we can figure out some things we might be able to start doing to give you a better handle on it that you have right now okay so let's put some boxes here and one ohm is going to be event these are the things that trigger your anxiety in this case the event was the draw having to drive to the to the pharmacy drive to pharmacy and then this next box I'm going to label something we call automatic thoughts and by automatic I mean that they occur relatively automatically they just sort of pop into your mind and you don't stop to check them out okay and we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts you don't have them everybody I know has them their inner thoughts in fact if you think about it for a minute we probably have a lot more plots we don't speak out loud that are part of our inner dialogues and thoughts we actually end up speaking aloud to other people and I suspect that you have lots of those watching just gave me some examples of it that's what we call an automatic so the like so what it yeah so let's put a couple of those down in this box okay in the automatic loss box they are what if someone runs into me yeah what if what else what if I get stranded get stranded um I can't do it I can't do it and there was this image about the rainstorm and you don't have any shoes on yeah out of work what should we put down for that I think what if I what if I can't get back home I can't get back home sort of lost yeah yeah what if I end up on this road forever mm-hmm and then we're going to put another box is it through the chain of events here uh-huh the event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety and sweetly so if you're thinking like this it makes sense that you'd be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions let's put those in here this is the emotions box mm-hmm and they are much shaky said yeah plus here yeah if we're going to write that fear on a zero to a hundred scale and she rose none at all in a hundreds of maximum anyone could ever get where would you be at this point oh I'd say about an eighty eighty pretty huh yeah it's gone higher though I suspect oh yeah yeah at this point is in eighteen okay and then you had some other feelings inside well I am yeah I sort of felt like I might fall over and I my heart was pounding and I didn't feel like I can breathe very well oh my gonna move okay yeah yeah so a lot going on here yeah in a pretty high level with this dress yes right and then we're going to complete this loop by putting a box we're going to call behavior this is how you actually acted when you're in the situation so what did you do if you had these thoughts and he had these feelings I went to the pharmacy you did do it I had to okay and what was it like for you when you were going to the pharmacy and driving there it was so bad I just you know I I think I've left permanent marks on the steering wheel because I was holding on okay yeah so in this case you actually did go over the pharmacy well you maybe didn't damage the steering noise yeah yeah but I really had no choice I mean I think usually I wouldn't go to the pharmacy usually I was called my I would call my husband and say can you pick it up on your way home get an escape route if you would yeah so usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as a model for many of these situations about driving and feeling um yes the usual behavior would be to try to get out of way to avoid it oh yeah oh yeah and so if you do avoid it then what happens well I feel better you feel better it's like such relief that's better relief the emotions called down though all right well yeah cuz I don't have to like I don't have to worry about it so that's what happens for a single episode this anxiety not wondering though if we look at the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief overall as far as managing driving what do you think it does there well I feel like I don't really have much confidence when it comes to this to being able to do it okay so in a way it decreases your confidence over time I think so yeah I suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things and what's that police yeah I don't feel like I can do it I can't do it I can't do it Knight comes back at this thought I can't do it yeah and you can't do it you don't do it right so here's this this chain of events events trigger thoughts we call an automatic thoughts and then they influence your emotions these feelings you have and then that influences how you handle the situation mm-hmm okay now let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this so let's take a look at these thoughts from it do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you yeah okay I mean like an example I mean I think almost everybody I think most people drive without too much okay problem but like my sister loves to drive yeah I mean she just she drives every opportunity she gets so for some reason we don't know exactly why but the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you was actually making change in this but you do have some differences in the way you think about driving that might be something that we could begin to work on in our session we might for example check it out what's the chances of someone slamming into you okay well what's the chances of you being stranded out there on the highway and even if you were stranded is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home so these are some things that we can to do so I'm going to or we could work on these thoughts okay and then by working on the thoughts we might be able to help you reduce the emotions but there also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that would be on to be able to calm yourself down in situations so we'll have some try to build some skills to manage your emotions and then on this behavior side one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up and again build your skills to do it mm-hmm and I can see that that process a little bit of edginess here what would you think of when I mentioned that I was thinking that I hope that this doesn't like make me worse you know like trying to do some of these things well I'm glad you gave me that feedback that's an example by the way of we want to hear from you about the way you're responding to what I'm saying I certainly wouldn't recommend you make it worse okay where to cause you too much anxiety uh-huh and what we'll try to do is pace it a trip to the level that's right for you okay so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be which is to be able to drive to your new office mm-hmm cross that big bridge mm-hm and maybe even like those couple hours to visit mission on all right yeah so what do you think well I think that that would if I could do those things that would be really nice yeah that could be really much too so that could be our goal yeah
