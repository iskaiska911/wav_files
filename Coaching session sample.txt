so thanks for coming in the reason I brought you in is because project Cobra you missed deadlines and concern I have is you know in the past we spoke about getting deadlines and we kind of went through a few things to help you something is not working correctly or something preventing you from the deadlines so can we have a discussion about it so we can see how we can help you to make sure that you don't miss deadlines going forward yeah James act to have been meaning to talk to you about it I mean for this project there's so many requests that are coming through so many different people giving me directions on on what to tweak and how to change things and it makes it very hard for me to really concentrate and try to crank up the deliverable and it's not willing me it's it's all of these other requests so I don't know what to do I mean they're all you know managers from the other teams and they're always but you know working on the same project but how am I supposed to handle all of these together okay so is it requests coming from other groups different responsibilities that are group pure and with the responsibility that you have is it's just people offloading work unto you because they don't have resources or they just want to push it to you because they're very good at what you do technically and people see you as a person who has done if it's a matter of too much work and your filters too much work coming in for you maybe what we should do is just sit down list out all the requests that have been given to you and we can go through them one by one where we can kind of say yes this is a priority for you for this deadline no this is not your work and then the two of us can go and talk to the individual who gave it to you and say no this shouldn't be assigned to you and so on down from the list you think that would be beneficial or we try something else as well I think that will be they'll be helpful okay it's it's a little bit of a combination about both of those okay so there are a lot of requires a lot of demands some are very project over again - some of them are not but I mean you know me I'd like to help out others just and what they have a request and I know I know that the data point that they need I'm gonna give it to them yes but sometimes I guess that's maybe why projects gets a little bit takes a little bit longer to to grow out than others so maybe what you can you know if I if I may next time when I have these requires can you help me pirate eyes because sometimes I don't know from a corporate corporation perspective what is more important than the others they're all coming to me okay so if I give you a lesson maybe we'll go through it every week or every other week and maybe you can give me some techniques on how to prioritize them what to ignore and what not to so that sounds like a good thing to do with you can generate the list of us on your plate at times we can once you have that done with a range of time would sit down and we'll go through it the other thing that I'm picking up from you is because you're so good at what you do but people know what and you can say no yeah everybody's coming to you so I think we should also do is arrange some time with you where I got troops and techniques on how you can tactfully tell people no because we've got our priorities and so you don't upset them and ruffle their feathers so to speak so that's all we can do all right I think that would be helpful but I think it'll be good for me to learn how to say no properly as well so I think I'll appreciate that session in terms of utter workload because this is just one specific project when you're putting your list together I'm also putting the list a lot of workloads that you have because okay but I don't want to see is that you're completely over stretched and that could be adding to it as well and you could feel pressure on there and you may be spending more time with other projects that are inter is important to to the company so be useful to see what are projects you're working on can help you then say this is priority water priority to and then you can I let you then decide what time you want to spend on each and would meet regularly to see how things are going then okay all right we'll do that I'll give you that list next weekend will may be all set all the time with that okay okay sounds good but thank you
