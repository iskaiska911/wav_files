okay so let's get started lauren um why don't you spend a few seconds just introducing yourself um before we get started um just in a nutshell my name's lauren and um i've been following tracy for three years i'm a tracy super fan love her i'm a wife and mom i have four kids and one on the way uh we homeschool we kind of homestead on the side we yeah we're just in the thick of it because our kids range from ten to one right now okay yeah so yeah like you said you're in the thick of it and um you have a lot going on and your attention is you know being pushed and pulled in many directions and so jumping in kind of like tracy how she said you know we're gonna start with really setting the agenda based on what you want to get out of today um so i know you had um your initial question was really around you know how to manage your day time management with the kids homeschooling building your own business but also in incorporating you know preserving your mental health right tell me a little bit more about that the mental health or just the whole thing the whole picture yeah at the tone i just like everybody can relate to it just feels like we're spinning a lot of plates and i just have felt like there's gotta be i must be missing something because it seems that i really can't spin them all well um and so i'm trying to demystify that and i understand that like i can't just get the process handed to me but perhaps i'm hoping to gain some insight and clarity about how to figure it out yeah yeah that was a really great example of us just splitting because i think so many people can relate to spinning so many different plates and i think i had heard one time you know we can do it all but maybe not at the same time so you know how do you manage your time how do you get what you want um out of your day your week your month um and we had talked yesterday really quickly just about like what's this vision that you have of the life that you want to lead and that's where coaching we bridge the gap between where you are and that vision um and so based on what you basically said and you even said like something feels like it's missing you would love the process to be handed over to you um what goals specifically would you like to get out of our session today today um well i guess the general i just want ideas like that's what i want to get out of today is new ideas i don't expect to solve my big problem in one session but the big problem being um how to manage my day build the business on my terms and preserve the mental health like i i want to start generating ideas yeah that makes total sense um and it really sounds like and i love how you just said you know i'm not going to be solving my problems right here but to walk away maybe with another perspective of you know something maybe that you weren't considering um as another option to successfully manage your day your business and your mental health right and additionally right now it feels like all the plates are very bare minimum survival mode plates and so what plate do you drop when every single one is like if i drop this there will be consequences totally and so so maybe some clarity about priorities that's exactly i think that and especially when we live in our heads and we don't have the space to talk through these things or even to just talk out loud it just feels like everything is equally as important and you know it is really kind of starting to say to yourself well you know what can i push here what can i put aside um and really talk through that right that makes total sense so the goal really being around that what's the most important and how do you get clarity on that so they're not all just surviving right right okay um so how will we know that we've been successful by the end of the session i've written something down we'll just call it that perfect perfect so just kind of feeling like a new maybe a new awareness that yes i haven't had before yes okay that sounds great and i'm writing things down so just to let you guys know when i keep looking down i write notes um and so why is this important to you now so i saw this thing it's like what breaks your heart like that's where it all lies like when you really think about what breaks your heart your why's and so what breaks my heart and forgive me if i'm a cry because i'm very pregnant but what breaks my heart is thinking that perhaps i'm not serving my children well or i'm cheating them out of my energy or my vitality or my passionate side or um even like uh financially if like i could do better with my business and like give them more like that's what breaks my heart so why is it important it's important for them my husband too of course but the children are younger and more dependent yeah so that's what's really um what tugs on my heartstrings right now absolutely and it makes complete sense and it's it really revolves around the energy that you're bringing and especially to your kids right you could focus all your energy in one area and feel like they're not getting any of it so how do you kind of really feel like you're giving them what they need but also then giving it to yourself and showing them that you are passionate about what you do right that sounds like it's really important to you too to be this role model for them to show them what it could be so okay great thank you for sharing that um so what do you believe you need to address or resolve to kind of gain this clarity around um you know juggling all these things that's a great question um like i said the priorities like i think we need to address the particular areas and then kind of resolve where they fall in line um i think i need to figure that out okay um just most what's most essential yeah yeah so often so it sounds like so what are your priorities what are the couple of areas of your life that way what are the areas of your life that are all what are all the plates all the place yeah okay so the animals we have animals and um i don't know why i listed them first no order of importance i think because they stress me out the most okay that's that's really interesting that you say that because i think part of this too will be saying like where is energy drained and where you feel alive the animals are first but not the most important so animal slash garden okay housework uh cooking that seems silly perhaps but in our house we do everything from scratch we're really into like holistic and all that so it's kind of a huge thing in our house um self-care and mental health that's another one parenting and then my etsy shop my youtube channel my marriage and then spirituality is also important yeah so yeah so there's a couple of categories and you have them all written down or okay so i was taking notes too um so the interesting thing you know would be is you know what stands out to you as the most when you look at that list you know where it's almost like this it's like the wheel of life right so every it's a round circle and if we wanted to rate you know where do you feel like that's it is on your scale right now one being like you're not satisfied 10 being like you're super satisfied what if we started to rate these okay um so that you can start to see priority and where to you know where you want maybe you want to put your energy right okay so each category we're gonna put a number like a one to ten number and then based on how it's um falls out now or how we can do both now and how do you want it to be okay you know so parenting i'll start there parenting slash homeschooling i didn't put homeschooling as its own category but we'll put it together um that right now i feel like we're at maybe uh six but i'd really like to be at eight nine or ten like i wanna be rocking that area um self-care and mental health i feel like i'm doing very well on this one right now it's i'd say it's a nine and i want to continue to prioritize that yeah okay cooking right now we're probably at a two because i'm about to have a baby and i'm very lazy and um i'd like to at least be at a six or seven there okay and then housework um not great let's call it a four right now and i feel like for my sanity i'd like that to be a six or seven too as well um the animals uh also a four and i'd like to bump them up to a six or seven we're seeing a pattern here right okay youtube um i'll give that one a five because i'm re-entering that world as of recently and i've done some really good work recently but this is after like a year-long sabbatical mm-hmm so i'd like that to be six seven mm-hmm okay etsy zero and i'd like that to be more of like an eight or nine okay okay and then marriage i'd give that a 7 and i want it to be a 10. and then spirituality we'll give it a 7 and i want it to be a 10. okay okay yeah so this makes complete sense we all want you know it's all areas of our life that you know and it's how we want to do one thing is how we do everything so we can probably find a common theme throughout these um but does anything stand out to you when you kind of just rank them yes i the things that seem so urgent the cooking the housework the animals don't seem to be my most important areas to me um and some of my most important areas spirituality marriage and parenting um just seem to be it's just interesting that the ones that are stressing me out the most are the ones that i care about the least yeah so what does that bring that's first of all what a great aha so it was good to like kind of get it out of your head yeah like we said um and i think that was just a really good great connection of like the things that are stressing you out the most are really actually maybe the least important to you and so you know what do you what what comes to your mind about that aha yeah i just feel like if i reversed it there's some fear here this is what i'm noticing like because if i spent more energy on the things that were so important i feel like everything would just go to pot because there's so much responsibility in those categories that are stressing me out um so i don't know what that would look like yeah well so it's what's in oh sorry do you have anything else coming up what's coming what's interesting is you know right now it sounds like and correct me if i'm wrong you're doing the bare minimum you're getting it done it's it could be better but like maybe one day if you had more time or something maybe you would focus there but it's like how do you kind of adjust you know what's the energy that you like you're saying they're stressing you out so is it about um doing more or is it just about acknowledging that these are what they are right now and i am going to put my energy elsewhere mm-hmm and also i'm wondering if there's ways to systemize these areas so they feel less large or you know something i've done which i don't really like but i've allowed processed food back into our life here and there um and that's helped my but i don't love it i feel like i'm compromising so what what comes to my mind and i'm curious what you think about this is you know like an 80 20 rule and you know how flexible are you with the choices that you make yeah and does that sound like something that you're interested in and that's a neat thought too because considering all the areas there's definitely some that um i call them like heaven and hell issues like some are not heaven and health issues and they are more flexible whereas there are other issues that for me would just be more like this is not i can't compromise this i really like that idea the 80 20. and so does that feel like particularly in these categories that you have identified as not being as important to you for whatever reason right um having a bit more flexibility around how you how you handle them and how you look at them mm-hmm yeah okay i'm writing a lot just by the way okay yeah and so you know you really wanted i'm just gonna i'll continue to go back to the goal to make sure because like conversations can go in so many different ways which is amazing especially making sure um you know the biggest goal was you know what's most important getting clarity around it and really you know prioritizing areas of your life so you know with those three things like is that does it feel like you would be able to walk away from this do you want to give more time to it are you like okay this is interesting i want to think through this but i want to go elsewhere and focus maybe on some of the other things yeah so i think i have a lot of clarity where my big rocks are that is very clear to me what's not clear to me is how to be flexible in the other areas so in these areas the stressful areas that are less important like okay i love this yeah okay so you feel like you know the things that are important to you especially helpful now that we listed them we rated them and you know those actually some of them had higher numbers in terms of satisfaction too so maintaining that but if you're able to maybe eliminate the stress you'd actually have more energy all around yes okay okay so based on that love it yes so i love this because really it is about the energy and if you're all stressed and you know worked up about things that aren't even important to you how does that carry through to everything else that you do right it's not positive right and it's exhausting and you're juggling and then you know as moms we probably can snap or that you know there's so many things that can come from the energy that we carry um so let's talk about it because you basically said this is probably um a bit of a fear um it is hard for you to wrap your head around not hard for you to wrap but it's unfamiliar to be flexible in these areas so tell me what comes up for you um when we think about it okay so let's just call these stressful areas homemaking for simplicity's sake okay because cooking housework animals like it's all falling under homemaking yeah um so uh hmm where do i want to go with this can you ask the question one more time um oh my god well what's coming to my mind is that with this homemaking if we were able to reduce the energy and be more flexible in these areas to free up energy for other things like what could that possibly look like yes um we might want to start with what is happening like how much time are you giving to this now yes um and what are you you know if do you want to dissect it a little bit to say okay this is what i do now and maybe there you know what would 80 20 look like right so a little bit about my background i didn't learn how to do this stuff growing up i wasn't taught it and so going into our marriage we're 11 years married now but going into it like i just didn't have a clue and i had to relearn everything and so i just went so narrow into this um and even still to this day i'm constantly learning so are you learning just to clarify you're learning about kind of creating home yes homemaking how to clean how to cook like all the things so now i feel like i have a pretty good idea of how but it's not always natural for me to implement it um and then so that's a little background now being flexible i know that you should and i hate that word but you know like one could allow their children to help them and i do and i try it's not natural like it's just not something i saw modeled so that's one area that it's like i could be flexible with how that looks division of labor another way you know i could be flexible i could say you know what my standards just aren't very high it's okay if it's a mess or whatever but that's not true to me either i really prefer a clean home um and then another way i could be flexible is just the process in which i do things the way i systemize it or um yeah so those are the three things that come to mind that's right i think that's great because to your point well you could you said you can allow the kids to help so you have options but it's just like what which way do you want to go and um you know it's like starting small you're not going to maybe have this all uncovered after you know we have this conversation so the three things you mentioned were you know allowing your kids to help you know kind of lowering your standards but that doesn't feel right that doesn't really feel good to you um and then the process in which you do things so i'm curious what's like tell me more about this process sure um so right now i've tried so many different things but right now i um utilize a google calendar and then i use google keep um and a task list on google i have like a projects cubby file thing that i use um so that's how i organize it in my head because that's the first step for me because it's all mental for me so that's the organizing in the head and then at the actual doing um because we homeschool we have to make breakfast lunch and dinner from scratch you know because that's one of our areas um and so the children are a part of the cleanup process for the meals um they're part of the animal chores in the morning first thing um they help with um like with the little littles when we're homeschooling it's like you're on such and such duty you know yeah they help with that um but they're still learning my oldest is 10. so it feels like chaos so what comes to my mind is like progress not perfection and i'm curious what you think about like you even said like lowering standards but is there like how does that feel just even having someone else do something i'm curious if you're like picking up the slack or you know going back and fixing after like what what is that no okay you're not just kidding definitely um after certain children don't do it the way i am nameless yes um something i let me tell you one of my wins uh laundry i figured out i oh tell me yes yes the kids all um have their very own basket which we color-coded and then when their hamper's full they're in charge of putting it in the wash and then they put their basket on top of the wash so we know who's there and then they can put it in the dryer and even the four-year-old he can manage this um and then they put it in their drawers they each have one drawer um and this is an area where i lowered my standards i said this is how you fold clothes i don't care if you fold it just put it in your drawers and i have one type a child that folds it neat and tidy and the other two just dump it but we don't have the issue of like them not having clothes like we used to because they see their hampers full they take charge and when that when i after so many years and pulling my hair out there i'm like there's gotta be like a dishes equivalent and hey um you know everything mopping your floor equivalent but i haven't figured it out i think that's really interesting though because it found it sounds like you collectively came up with a system that works right um and then you did say like okay if it's not perfect i don't you know your clothes are you put them away and i'm okay with that yeah so you know is there something that stands out as like you can even start with like what's the most what's the thing right now that makes you want to pull your hair out yeah and you just something you said just made me think of something the scene versus the unseen yeah i can't see what's in that drawer and i know some personalities like would really care what's behind the drawer but i'm an out of sight out of mind person and so there's a lot of power in this scene versus unseen for me i love that um okay so thank you for that about that and then you um just the power because perhaps when looking at our day i can see the things that are going to mentally fog me up um a sink full of dishes for example when the dishwasher goes out and like because i can see those dishes drying in the sink or whatever whereas the dishwasher is like well they're hiding in there um and so there's you know the rooms that i'm in more often perhaps could be put more emphasis on like keeping picked up and then the unseen rooms anyway i'm just like kind of spinning some ideas this is what i love about coaching is like i'm i just said something i know that i didn't know that you would even pick up on yeah but it was just be kind of like processing back what you kind of said i like when they're in their drawers i don't care as much like it you know so that takes stress off because if you if it wasn't that way you'd be like oh my god they have to go and do this you know and so it sounds like there maybe is something here and i like how you just said too where you're spending your time is maybe where the focus can be so the other stuff is just let it be and by not feeling you have to do it all does that maybe feel like you're not putting your energy in spaces that deplete you yep i love it awesome yeah so how many likes so tell me like when you think about that and i initially said like what makes you want to pull your hair out um i'm curious now um you know right now i think the thing that's stressing me because i am about to have a baby in a month is the kids don't seem very um independent which that sounds so silly because their children sound silly to me um and what but what i mean by that is like i really have to direct my sheep so it just kind of drives me crazy um and the way this is related to homemaking is that yes i can ask them to do this and that and the other but it doesn't happen organically it's not happening except for the laundry yeah so i mean but i think that's how do we learn from what you did with the laundry mm-hmm possibly take another area yeah and apply because it seems like again that system works like was did it work right away they like immediately like jumped on to it they did and i think that i need to figure out what my kids really care about because all of them care about having clean clothes yeah i i know some kids don't but mine are like i'm out of such and such like well you have the tools uh-huh so what do my kids care about like if they don't care if there's dishes they don't care it doesn't affect them um unless maybe it did you know and yeah i mean dishes yeah and it is interesting because you identified something that was important to them uh-huh but you know maybe is there a way to maybe not make it so complicated like sure i'm curious like what comes to mind when it's just like this needs to get done making it fun i think is something that works for us um we've utilized fly ladies home blessing hour every monday and we all do it together it's so fun all right and wait what's that tell me for those who aren't familiar it's not like a blessing of the home that's what she calls cleaning her home blessing her home a certain time on a monday it's one hour and she live streams and she gives you tasks like okay go do this go do this you know so we've been doing that for a long time so they've come to expect it so ritual and routine but it's also fun yeah i'm so bad at sticking to routines though so that's another thing it's another topic but here what's so interesting is that you do have this monday time so that's a routine right you know so how could you you know what are you working with how do you say maybe one day or whatever you feel like you need to create this ritual routine and make it fun with them like what could that be yeah around the home making or the thing that stresses you out the most and is it the dishes or the dishes are a big one yes but it's so but the thing that stresses me out so much is it just feels like chaos because there's so many little people and then there's toys and there's dishes and i think it's just a mental clutter yours your environment does affect you know your energy yeah and so even thinking that and noticing that and again maybe this is about clearing the space where you are most of the time i mean the kitchen is like its own beast because that's where you eat and like you're saying it's three meals a day like there's always these dishes right so that is an area but then where else is there maybe an opportunity to like clear the space for you because it feels like those clutter or there's more stuff than you want right now plus all these little people yes yes yes um and then as a large family this is something i'm trying to demystify too on my own it's like even like if you're a minimalist large family it's still a lot of stuff and it's like yeah um you know i have my kids they have enough outfits for um like basically a week of clothes and they have one pair of going out clothes and another pair of like fancy like wedding or church clothes that's it but you add that up between four children that's a lot of clothes um so decluttering is always on my mind specifically the homeschool shelves i think are an area that are very visible that could potentially be at the very least stored differently so that they're not visually and so obtrusive so that's that's something that i'd like to work on yeah there's two things that are really popping out is just this idea of like the things that kind of stress you out completely um noticing what those are so like having the clarity like if you're just walking around and you notice like oh like every time you walk past something you feel something like that's something to maybe pay attention to and think through these ideas of like okay um seen but unseen is something that i kind of relate to it is like almost like a superpower or you know i know that like i can manage things that when it's unseen it feels better for me it feels less stressful so like that's one thing and then this idea that like help having your kids help but ritual routine and fun is a piece of that like that might help you just navigate and it really is around when you are like somewhere just noticing are you like tense do you walk by something and you're like oh god i can't handle this one more time so it's like paying attention to those moments when your body like kind of tenses yes absolutely and there's the actual like what we're seeing is making me tense because it's stress because it's cluttered or whatever but then there's the mental game too like say there's a project you've been wanting to get to or you know and you walk past the mess and it's the guilt so it's that self-talk yeah it's like oh i should be doing that thing um so i think that there's tension in both types of situations yeah yeah lens your point self-talk and i think it is around two is this idea of um you know what is it what is it to say what is it to feel this is not that important i'm okay with it being this way like i'm gonna actually focus my energy here right now and what's empowering about that is you're making a choice to focus on what's really important and so that's when you know you could go down a spiral of i should be doing this i'm not doing that i never get to this or it's like no i made a cho i'm making choices to focus on my family i'm making choices to focus on my marriage care yeah like in those moments can you start to maybe create this awareness and observe yourself and kind of say but wait is this really important to me right now right right um because it feels like we have to check in with ourselves a lot of times when there's so many different things happening yeah um so that we can remember because not like you said there's so many spinning plates but maybe they're not well whatever you want to give your attention to right and the fact that you are aware of that now is where you can start to like really feel empowered that you're making choices of the things that these are my important things that feels really good i love the power of that word choice or choose like you know i choose to cook from scratch i choose to homeschool my children like all of these like even the things that feel maybe like you can feel a victim to them but it's like i choose to be a homemaker like i choose to own a homie like you know like these are all choices and that's a lot more empowering than feeling drunk or victimized by your circumstance yeah so like with that new way of thinking how does that make you want to possibly move forward with some of these things well it just really just gives me enthusiasm and excitement i just feel like oh what are the things i can choose what are the things i can choose to shatter on the ground and things that i can choose to really dive into and guilt-free right yes and knowing you know we are you know no one's making you feel guilty it's our own life towards something so it's also just when you when you're acknowledging that you're making choices that are serving you and your family like that stuff it doesn't have you don't have to feel the guilt right you're like wait no i'm making a choice yes and then one other thing like just what a gift it is to be talking right now like these are very much first world problems like i'm this is amazing and a blessing to be able to be discussing stuff like this like and to get like so worked up about um these choices like it should be an empowering beautiful thing that's your and i love that you recognize that we are programmed to feel like we should be doing things they should look a certain way i you know my standard it's my standards or nothing else like we're just programmed that way and normally and it makes sense like that's when you like we have these measurements of success and if we don't meet them then we're hard on ourselves whereas to your point like navigating through these things is the same as you would do with any sort of issue we don't want to minimize because you know you're juggling a lot and all these things but um you know these like these little tools and the questions to be like what's most important to me or you know what am i focusing on right now and just to really be aware of our mindset is just really helpful as you continue to navigate right because there's always there's always something right where there's always something you can't walk around just being like everything's so great but like and you want it to be better so that you can be more efficient and really the goal is for you to show up energetically right as your best self yeah so the goal was um to really kind of gain this clarity around what was most important to really talk through some areas of your life how do you feel like we did i really appreciate the ground we covered i'm very happy with this and i wrote a lot of notes and i do feel more clarity about the situation um and i had some aha moments which that is such a gift yeah so tell me some of the ahas what do you think you are walking away with the scene versus unseen um and then just flexibility just kind of looking that at that in a different way um and then also like knowing what my big rocks are i knew that but also realizing that like the what does tracy call it catabolic energy from my little rocks like um yeah yeah it's like oh i didn't realize the little rocks were the pesky little things interesting and so that that was an aha yeah and then just very practically i need to go clean the homeschool shelves so it sounds like you have an action step yes that you're gonna do when we leave the call today yes yeah and i think it's such a great um you know that's where the eli the energy leadership assessment really identifies like okay all the different levels of energy what does catabolic energy do um to us because we there's always stress but like what you know how does it make your perspective how does it make you show up and to your point it could be like the littlest things but like it does it does bear weight um and so to be able to then shift to be like okay well what's another way of looking at this what's the opportunity here um and using some of those tools to help you kind of like raise your energy so that you feel excited and empowered and ready to take on right whatever it is mm-hmm yeah okay so a question i like to ask sometimes is you know what are you discovering about yourself through this session um hmm i what am i discovering about myself that's like a really deep question that i might have to chew on for a little bit but i'm discovering um how just how curious i really am um and willing to i have a willingness and but it's in a fun way i i sometimes feel that i'm so rigid and like like a real stress squad but i i don't think i am i'm discovering that there's a curiosity a wonder and an openness i love mine that's really amazing and identifying that you have this fun side of yourself and you you even spoke about fun within the session so you know a great thing is to kind of even asking your kids well what can make this more fun right now you know because if you can look through the lens of just having a little bit more lightness um versus structure which structure is good like don't get us wrong right yes structure in life but like to have a nice level of energy of fun in within it yeah playfulness and and you came to the the session with that completely that that curiosity and wonder and openness to learn so i'm so thankful for this time together with you me too thank you yeah and so is there anything else that you feel unique before you leave today um i i think this ties it in a very pretty bow and i don't want to like open up pandora's box and so i'd like to leave it at this if this isn't perfect for you it's perfect for me and so the great thing about coach and i'll just round this out now is that you know there was a beginning a middle and an end right and memorized kind of what you were walking away with what are the action steps that you want to take this is where you know if we were partnering together and working together longer accountability comes in um you might say i'm going to do something and lo and behold we meet a week later and you're like i didn't get it done and you kind of say to yourself okay well what blocks did you have was beer coming up or was it just like external stuff and we were able to explore and again get curious and understand and maybe try something new and that's what i love about this process is it's really an experiment um discovering what works really well for you right and where do you feel like you're getting depleted in energy and just to have that awareness to kind of notice those things and so it was a really great experience and i'm really happy um and i would love for you to let me know how organizing your bookshelves go thank you welcome thank you this like just to anybody watching like sitting in the seat it feels so good so if you're kind of on the fence like this just it feels good to talk to yourself but with an advocate absolutely yes because you weren't leading me like you were you were guiding me yeah there's a difference in your answers yeah it feels very good and empowering right and it's remembering that you do have the answers within you but they definitely sometimes get it gets confusing yeah yeah you know and we forget so thank you again so um before we leave um i just want to say thank you to everyone who hopped on to watch or who is watching the replay um and like tracy
