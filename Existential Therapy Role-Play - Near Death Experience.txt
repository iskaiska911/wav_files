all right yeah what brings you in to castle two weeks ago there was a there was a fire at my apartment okay no everybody's alright everybody alrig everybody that was in my apartment is all right okay I mean everybody I knew it was all right you know but but it was scary you know so what happened was the electricians had just come in they're doing some work all right I didn't know what they were doing those at work but they were doing something and I thought everything was fine all the lights worked everything was good so I just came back from work and I was I was asleep I was kind of dozing off and I thought it was still awake but I started hearing these sparks and just got I'm still asleep you know not really sure what's going on but sorry I start hearing these sparks and then next thing I know I wake up and there's just smoke everywhere you know like everywhere like I couldn't see anything my eyes were tearing up like I couldn't keep him open with all that smoke and stuff I I didn't know where I was I didn't know where the door was I was in a panic you know I just nothing made sense in that moment really scary really yeah it was and I so I panicked and I didn't know what to do and I was freaking out and so it must have been at that point that the fireman came in now my brother was also in the apartment he must've gotten out at the same time I did I don't know but I we're both safe you know for meetings fine but but it you know it scare me it you know I mean it makes you think about the things that you take for granted you know like go to work all the time all the time and I do overtime and I go in on Saturdays and and even Sundays if they would let me you know just trying to make more money and buy more things and pay off this and do that and this and that would ever give our cars and then all kinds of stuff you know and then this happen today none of it was really worth it you know everything was gone in the fire anyway so what's that matter you know and you know all the time that I didn't spend my family that I could have and it just made me second-guess often you know used to want to get all kinds of stuff but now I'm like someone who won't anymore and I I don't know it is it's kind of weird you know so they told the way you relate to the world like you have a new perspective on it yeah definitely and it happened like that you know like you know how they say that stuff kind of flashes before your eyes when you think that you're gonna die you know it's kind of what happened like I you know I I didn't think about all my stuff first I mean I thought about like you know I'm leaving all these people behind you know I didn't think about any of this stuff thought about people you know so at the moment you're facing death because you thought yeah I was there I didn't know what was gonna happen at any second yeah they don't do it that this life will be over yeah so at that moment when you're you're thinking that you're really what you're saying is you're not you weren't thinking about all that you've earned or advances in your career no no that really seemed to come into play at that last what could have been that last moment yeah no no I didn't think of any of it but I thought I've worked so hard to get to that you know at that point I didn't think of anything it was all useless in that moment because I you know you kind of think of what's really worth it so what do you think is valuable now I think the things that will make a lasting impression like like like people like family like having relationships with people you know like like being with your parents and your siblings and people that you know your friends you know that stuff that really makes a difference you know so those relationships those people they have value and it seems like you're kind of relating to that world more than like the world of objects yeah which is what you seem to be with 82 more before and that's because of this really frightening experience we couldn't lost your life yeah yeah I mean there's yeah I mean I you know we're dealing with the insurance company all that you know but it's almost like I don't even want to buy any more stuff off the money thank you you know like what's it really gonna matter anyway you know thankfully I still have all the people that I know and love you know but just like that it could have been over and that ever occurred to you before this this incident I mean you know you think about it you think about it sometimes you know you're like wow you know really I could die any second and I don't I'm not gonna see it coming maybe you know but it's a whole different thing when you experience it you know it's like that really could have been it could have been it so before it was kind of more abstract the way you thought about that yeah yeah yeah me before I really kind of felt invincible like you know I'll die eventually but you know not for you know 60 years maybe I'll reach 100 you know that so no real need to think about now that's something for the future way down the road yeah but now the concept for you is a little more concrete yeah what happened yeah definitely it's kind of its kind of pushed into your view I guess what you're seeing now mm-hmm yeah it is I mean it's not you know I don't I don't think I really think about it that often you know like oh I could die right now it's not an anxious kind of thing but I guess it's an awareness kind of thing you know that I could you know or that um have I been the person that I want to be or you know or have I done what I wanted to do or have I been with the people that I wanted to be with or things like that you know it just kind of makes this this new mentality I guess so everyone who dies dies under some set of circumstances and tell us things prior to that maybe what's troubling you is you want to know that you've done all you can do with the people that are important to you so when your time does come which I hope would be way far in the future you can appreciate that you really lived the way you want to live yeah does that kind of is that close yeah and in that moment with the fire that's not the thought you were having you you think maybe you didn't use all the time in the way that would have been the best yeah damn you have a lot of regrets you know like what if I had went to see my parents more or you know what if I went to you know spend time with friends more or something like that you know mm-hmm it's a scary thought but it's it's real you know yeah I guess for you really kind of real all of a sudden yeah this is a joke there's a jolt that you had this this really kind of yeah really changed your perspective you come to this realization real quick it's not something you think through it's like immediate in the moment I'm about to die this is my thought it's it's it's on it's unreal I mean it's not something you can even replicate you know I could never replicate that thought in that short amount of time but that intensity no yes you know you've had strong frightening experience and you've come out of it kind of existing relating to another world on top of the world you were relating to yeah so it's objects not so much now more people that good use you mentioned you didn't care about the objects but the insurance and yeah I mean so it's like why would I you know why would I return that you said the world you know so why would I want to return to that world of stuff you know of objects of accumulating things didn't speed right back where I was you know so it sounds to me like you want to channel this really negative and scary experience into something that can change your life from a positive in a positive way yeah definitely I mean it already has really you know I mean like there's a part of me that just can never go back to the to an old mindset you know yeah just it's kind of it's kind of broken you free course helped you break free yeah I would say so yeah in terms the way you think and relate and what you value mm-hmm definitely it forced you in a sense to take a hard look at your values yet it yeah look a quick immediate look at the way I live my life yeah so what do you think you can take moving forward from this experience um you know really I think about that the thought that I had when I was in the fire you know the this is the end and the the who instead of the what you know and really I think about that way I think about that all the time you know and whatever I do you know if I'm at work doing something and this thought pops in my head it's just this feeling I guess I feel this feeling of that scene it was similar feeling that I felt when I was you know in the fire I thought it was the end you know and it makes me kind of reconsider what I'm doing you know instead of saying like the other day instead of working yeah it was lunchtime you know normally what I did was it work right through you know I get more done and that's that's what my boss likes but instead I'm like that's not what this is about you know so I went and I had lunch with some of my friends that I work with you know and there was made me feel good you know it was like this this is more so what it's about you know if I'm gonna be at work I should really get to know the people that that I'm working with so another moment of having lunch with them you were feeling like you're really living life more the way you wanted yeah yeah and when your first inclination before the fire would have been worked through right like you know get work through lunch get more stuff done that the boss will like me have me come in on Saturday maybe Sunday but but now so why would I ever come in Saturday or Sunday like I don't need to you know I can spend time with other people you know or even during lunch and spend time with other people or I can you know go walk around outside like I did that the day after it was like wow you know maybe I could see if they want to walk around we did and it was great and there's a fulfillment there you know then they didn't have before I thought everything was going smooth before it was but there wasn't an excitement there there wasn't a vibrancy the kind of stuff that I'm feeling now and I want to feel you know that's kind of what it's about so it made the world in a sense that moment made the world a much scarier place but now it's made the world a place where you can be happier yeah enjoy it more appreciate it more yeah so you've had a lot of insight in a really short amount of time and you feel like the trajectory of your values of your life has changed yeah we can maybe find more meaning definitely yeah absolutely well what a what a powerful story frightening and also value changing a lot of different perspective you have a lot to reflect on it sounds like that's what you've been doing you've been reflecting one yeah particularly that specific thought that you had in that moment and that thoughts coming back and maybe reminding you something that you you you want to think of yeah yeah yeah not the scary part but more than what my value part that's the best of thought that keeps coming back yeah yeah yeah yeah there's no anxieties there anything you know no real you know fear that stops me or anything but it is more the positive stuff like what am I gonna do with this now well what would get a powerful story I'm glad everybody's okay yeah yeah and I think that you've taken away you're taking away a lot from a brief powerful frightening experience yeah and it seems like you're really trying to channel at that direction that's gonna allow you more freedom and fulfillment at life so let's do this I'll see you again in a week that works for you yeah keep reflecting on how your values now are or seeming to you what what they look like now as compared to what they look like before that's really what there is here there's a discrepancy between like a new version of you an old version of you yeah so if you could reflect on some of that and and kind of tell me like much like you told me here like what you've done differently what's really changing and and let's see what kind of insight we can uncover into how you're relating with these different environments yeah that's gonna do great well appreciate coming in and I'll see you in a week sounds good thank you thanks Rick
