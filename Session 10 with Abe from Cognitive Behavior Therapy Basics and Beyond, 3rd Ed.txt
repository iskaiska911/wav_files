hi eve how you doing pretty good oh i'm so pleased to hear that can i just take a quick look oh yeah this does look like you're feeling better great okay how about if we do an update so what was good about the past week well some of the things that i've been doing and working on are are still going well so like still being in contact with the family i contacted charlie well when i saw charlie i asked him if i could have some more hours and he said yes so that made me feel good for for a bunch of reasons um i called john and he seemed happy to hear from me so so that was good you know a couple weeks ago you were even afraid to ask charlie for any hours at all you remember that because you made a negative prediction about it because of the way that my last job ended i i was afraid that nobody would would give me any hours or hire me or or want me at all so and then charlie did so i guess that prediction turned out to be wrong and then sounds to me as if you did well enough that charlie is willing to give you a few more hours he did give me a few more hours and so far that that's going okay great do you feel like you've done a reasonable job working for charlie oh yeah um it's it's mostly labor so it doesn't it it isn't hard uh mentally it's it's just hard physically but yeah i'm doing it i show up on time and things are going well so what was uh good this week about working for charlie and what did that mean the fact that you've done this well the the the fact that i can get there on time that i can do a good job um i think it builds my confidence a little bit just being being back to work because i was really worried after the last job because of the way that that ended whether or not something bad might happen this time yeah yeah it doesn't sound like it has is that right yeah so yeah did it feel good to be productive well yeah yeah and it sounds like you were on time so you were reliable you did a good job in what you were doing yeah in fact such a good job that he's willing to give you some more yes well you know it's summertime construction he's got a lot of work and so you know the fact that i i wanted some hours he seemed happy that i wanted them that's great and you reconnected with john because you had also made uh some negative predictions about that i think yeah yeah so i i talked to him and he he seemed happy to hear from me you know which what do you make of that you know i i don't know i i guess things are okay with him and and you know i i was worried that because i hadn't called him or been in contact with him for for a long time i was afraid he just sort of written me off you know as we talked about last week of course he hadn't called you either yeah so it sounds like that two of you just let each other slip a little bit and and now you're back what would have happened if you had really bought into this automatic thoughts he's not going to want to hear from me wouldn't have called him no i don't think he would have so it's so good that you called him right yeah yeah and it was taken a little bit of a risk there right because you really thought that he might not uh take too kindly to your call yeah so you put yourself out there that's good is this another example of how you took control yep you know because because well like you said i wouldn't have yeah that's good uh so anything else happen this week that i should know about um no not that i can think of right now so let's uh set our agenda what's the goal for today's session um did you write something down about that yeah i've since i've been writing lots of stuff down um oh so my daughter's having a barbecue and her in-laws are coming and are going to be there i see and i'm worried about what they're going to think about me because of you know everything that's happened to me and so is your goal to reduce your worry about seeing her in-laws or is it a different goal well it's reducing the worry but i don't know what to say to them oh okay so it's both and i think so if so we could figure out figuring out what to say yeah and if we do that then that should reduce the worry is that right okay yeah probably if i knew i i mean i just don't even have any idea what to say i have some ideas i think that i think this is a pretty easy one okay um but an important one any other goals for this session um well if you think of anything let me know that's the main thing i mean okay yeah uh can we take a look at your homework the um you're actually i'm sorry your action plan my action plan okay uh yeah so do you want to start reading the action plan to me if i think that i should be all better by now because that was your thought you had had last week right i should be yeah yeah well yeah my thought was i shouldn't have been that bad in the first place that's right that's true i remind myself that i am somewhat better and i i am somewhat better and and i did that you are i straightened up my apartment that that took uh quite a while didn't it yeah and you got it done yeah that that reminds me of another thing if we have have time like that i was straightening up my apartment and i i put some stuff out in the hallway and um one of my neighbors was upset that i put it there instead of taking it all the way down to the dumpster so the goal of of this would be what to talk to your neighbor to feel better about the situation no i i guess that i i can tell you about that but i don't think we need to spend time on that okay all right so back to the action plan um i've worked a couple times in construction okay i've i've done that and that's gone well i'm doing more with the kids and the families been doing that good um i reconnected with well i was already connected with charlie but got more with him and and reconnected with john right so i'm doing as well as could be expected for someone who was severely depressed in may what do you think about that i i don't know what the expectation would be but i think i'm doing as well as i can good that's good i'm doing all the right things well i don't know the things we talk about here i i i've tried to do excellent but it's still going to take longer until i'm feeling normal again exactly do you think it was helpful to read this or it really just didn't make much of a difference oh i think it was helpful during the week right right now i don't um it just sort of seems like it all came and worked out the way it was supposed to excellent so i think it's okay so what else was on your action plan talk to charlie i did that good keep looking for customer service jobs were you able to do that well i did but that's hard because you know you're filling out things online and you're not talking to somebody and i i don't really you know they ask you for what have you been doing and i don't know how to explain what i've been doing for the past two years so is that something for our agenda yeah probably so we have the um the barbecue at your daughters-in-law your daughter your at your daughters for and you'll see her in laws and then filling out the job applications uh and what to say about not working and let's see are you able to keep giving yourself credit yeah i'm doing that that's good and did you do a testing your thoughts worksheet i did that was what i started to tell you that was when i was cleaning my apartment and i put this some of the stuff out in the out in the hallway just until i had it all ready to go at the same time and my my neighbor complained to me and you know initially when he started complaining i i i thought that i you know was doing something wrong or should have done it differently or whatever but then i i went through this and i sort of came to conclusion no i had a pretty good plan you know i was getting the stuff from the apartment to the hallway and then it was all going to go from the hallway out out to the trash bin and it was in the middle of the day it wasn't bothering anybody out there that neighbor who's so picky yeah yeah sounds that way but how great that you didn't let what he said affect you too strongly yeah is that right well initially it did but then i've still got this and it reminded me i used this and thought well let me think this through and since i i had the form i just went through and did it i think that's great worked out that's great so let's see what from the homework might you want to continue doing this coming week i'm not sure you need to keep on reading this about this thing about i should be better by now it sounds like that's pretty much in your head i'm doing better i'm doing better and i think you already asked charlie we're going to talk about the job applications the um you're going to still keep the credit list yeah better and keep on doing some worksheets yeah when you need to yeah because yeah because there's still i still have weak moments good all right so we have the barbecue and we have the job applications is there anything that's even more important than those two things no so which would you like to see you want to make sure we get to both of them or if there's only time for one how would you like to spend the time that's a um let's do the job applications because the barbecue is still a couple weeks away okay so we don't get to it if we don't get to that today that'd be all right yeah but the job apps i you know that is bothering me every day good let's talk about that then it sounds like you were able to identify at least a couple of jobs but then you got kind of daunted when you saw the application well when when it asked me you know ask for prior employment and and they ask you to sort of do things by date yeah and then i've got this like big hole right the past two years what do i put in there you know dropped off the end of the earth i mean i don't know what to put in there uh and is there anything any other hard parts about the application or is that really the one that's bothering you the most well i i have to explain why i left the last job but i mean i know what to say there i don't know what they're going to think about it but but i know how to explain it right so you don't need my help with that no no so let's talk about how you could fill in the application can i ask you some questions about this sure so if i remember right when you first lost your job you looked around a little while for new jobs and didn't find anything and then weren't you helping out charlie back then um yeah a little bit so you had a few days of helping with construction then yeah and you've had a few days recently yeah so i wonder whether you could put down that you've been working in construction i can you think charlie would give you a good reference yeah i think he would but but i haven't done a lot of work for charlie that's the only thing i i think do you have to put on the application how much work you've done well i suppose it could come up in a job interview but how about just on the application i'd be afraid to say that i've been working the whole time for mean because i haven't and charlie will tell them that yeah i mean that i so i i don't i mean i can tell them that but i think i need to tell them more okay maybe is there even room on the application to explain like that one of the things that one of the things that you could do is that you could just put down um uh two years the date for two years ago and um the date of this year and have one year with nothing unless you think that actually did work in that intervening year you could put that one in too so and if you put them down with commas i think what that usually means to people is that it wasn't continuous or you would have said you know this year to that year i think i could also put on there that i've done some volunteer work oh yeah that's good too so that it won't look like i just sat around the whole time right so that you're going to put down the work at the homeless shelter the homeless shelter yeah and i've done a couple like special project think well this was before well with the church i don't know if i can use that or not but well i can just say i did volunteer work and use the homeless shelter as right as a place and you could also say you you you did do some work yeah at the church you think that's been in the last uh two and a half years and i kind of dropped off the church around that same time okay so just leave it off then how does that sound yeah so i can say that i've done construction when it was available i've done some work in the homeless shelter good i can say that now when you get an interview do you think that the company that you're going to apply to has hired other people in the last couple years you know probably might be an expanding company might not be right but i'm just wondering whether the job interviewer knows that it's more difficult for people to get jobs when they're in their 50s than when they're in their 20s and 30s and 40s they probably know because they're the ones not hiring us exactly right and so i wonder whether in your interview you might be able to say honestly that you've been looking for a job but that it's been difficult yeah so i don't think there's a place for that on the job application but i thought maybe it'd be good for you to start thinking about that i mean the other thing about it is that my last except for the last few months when i was there i was working as a supervisor and then it makes it hard to go into a new place and get a job as a supervisor nobody wants to hire they want to hire you at entering level positions and so you can't just go over there and but if i could get a job in in customer service i mean even if i had to start at the bottom i think i'd be okay with that that's good and do you have something good in mind that you can say if the interviewer says but you were a supervisor before and this is an entry-level job what would you say back well but this is in the area where uh where i like to work and and so i'm willing to take an entry level job the problem that i had at my last job is that they moved me from customer service over to inventory and i didn't know how to do that there was i mean there were computers and there were spreadsheets and stuff and i i didn't grow up with that stuff i didn't know how to do that so as long as i was working at customer service i was doing good that's when they moved me to inventory that i had a problem yeah oh i think that's a great answer if an interviewer says what happened with the last job okay so so what could get in the way of filling out the job application now well i mean just just that i would have the thought that even if i put down construction and volunteer work that that won't be enough but i mean i think that that's the best plan i have right now so i'll just i'll just put it down i mean i can't can't get any worse results than what i've already gotten yeah do you need to write down if i think that they won't like my lack of work history remind myself this is the best plan i have anything else on the job applications no can i just ask you one more question what does it say about you as a person that you're willing to go into an entry-level job well i just people need to work people for me i have a i mean i think that work is important i think that earning money is important so you have a good work ethic and it doesn't sound as if you know some people would feel themselves too superior to take an entry-level job doesn't sound like you have that sense about yourself i would just be happy to be working yeah so i think that does that show that you're humble that you have good values that you that you would put productivity over superiority i don't know if it means that or not but okay sounds good anything else on this or should we talk about the barbecue talk about the barbecue okay so it's in a couple of weeks yeah and do you have a picture in your mind of what the barbecue is going to be like yeah i'm imagine i'm going to go there and then my my wife and her family are sort of gonna you know be talking and stuff and your your ex-wife no no no no your daughter my daughter oh your daughter and her family my daughter and her family are are going to be there and talking and everything and then i just sort of imagine that her in-laws are going to be sort of over on the side just talking among themselves okay and that's going to be awkward and and difficult to to break into and i'm i'm going to walk in my my daughter will be happy to see me and and and my son-in-law too but um what do you think is going to be the most difficult moment for you i think after i say hello to my daughter and her husband and my my grandkids there's going to be a time when everybody recognizes that i've said hello to everybody but i haven't had any done any talking with her in-laws and i think that that's going to be a difficult moment so have you had difficulties uh in talking to them before how often have every do have did you only see them like at the wedding and not since or you've seen them periodically well i probably saw them one or two times but not not regularly it's not like we were ever friends i mean part of that was that when i was when i was married before we didn't really do things with other people together so i never really saw them or really got to know them that much and when you did have a little bit of time with them what was your impression of them perfectly nice people they were okay they seemed friendly that was when i was working and when i felt normal and now i haven't been for such a long time i don't know what they're going to think about me well what are you afraid they're going to think about it yeah they're going to they're going to think that i'm just lazy irresponsible do you have a picture in your head of and believing this about you yeah like i'm sitting there once we get to that moment after i've said hello to everybody then i sort of look over at them and they look back at me and they have you know just this look on their face of you know disapproval and do you have any evidence is there something that makes you think that they'll be critical of you or do you have any evidence that makes you think that they won't be critical of you or do you really just not know i don't know i just assume that everybody thinks that about me well is that what john thought about you when you reconnected with him no is that what charlie thought no is it what your kids have thought all along no no so is it what i think of you no but that's your job well it is my job to try to look at things realistically now i don't know how to look realistically about your your daughter's in-laws i don't know whether they're going to be critical or not the question is is it worth it to you to act as if you feel confident and is it worth it to you to go up to them and if they ask what have you been doing lately you could say you've been working construction you could say you're looking for you'd like to get back into customer service so you've been applying for jobs in that yeah so if you were to say that in kind of an upbeat way what are the chances do you think that they'll be really critical of you not to my face anyway yeah and um after you say that you know if you want you can just very quickly change the subject would you like to do a little role play on this so do you want to be you or you want me to be you sure i should be me okay so and who am i the wife or the husband who's easier to talk to that's what i'm trying probably the husband is easier for me to talk to because we can talk about sports and stuff oh that's good what's what's his name um it's a funny name it's elias elias yeah all right i'm elias and do i come up to you or do you come up to me well i mean that's the question so i've said hello i look over i see them sort of looking at i they're settled so i guess i have to go over okay to you and remember now what i want you to do is to act as if you have confidence act as if you feel good about the fact that you're doing construction that you're looking for another job act as if you expect them to be nice to you so if you have that if you have that attitude what does your face look like like that right that smile right kind of this open the smile what does your posture look like you're feeling confident about yourself i guess i'd have to probably sit up straight stand up straight or stand up straight stand up you'd probably stand up right i'd stand up and so go over so you're coming to me i'm elias so you're standing up straight you're smiling you come over to me and you say hi elias how are you doing pretty good good it's good to see you yeah i haven't seen you for a long time nice to see you too you know i'm i'm retired now and uh i'm tough to tell you i'm enjoying retirement how about you well i i i i'm still still in the game a little bit i'm you know i i've i've been doing a little bit of construction and you know i'd like to get back into customer service if i could so i've been yeah i've been looking at jobs with that that's good and i know you know the even though the economy is booming it just seems hard for people our age to get jobs it's hard yeah people don't seem to want to talk to me yeah so anyway oh that's unfortunate well okay how about if you change the subject now well that's unfortunate what do you think about the phillies this year i'm so disappointed i have to tell you you know after last season i really thought they had a chance but i don't know uh you know they're not doing too well well you know they've got some expensive players and i i thought they'd do better but so are you going to any games i haven't i haven't yet i'd like to sometime but i like to wait to see see them do better too yeah you know i went to see a couple games early on that's when they were we're doing well but i haven't gone for a while either yeah so i i don't know things don't look that good for them right now maybe i don't know maybe the eagles have a better chance this year yeah i hope so i don't have to tell you i'm much more of a baseball fan though than a football fan yeah okay let's come out of role play first of all i thought everything you said was great second of all you look pretty depressed when you were telling me all this stuff i wonder if we could just try it once more and have you try to feel confident let me ask you a couple questions you know one of the things that you read about here was that you really have made a fair amount of progress and that you are right where you should be given how depressed you were last may so you are you know right on the road where you should be right now the second thing is look how much more you're doing these days than you did before and the fact that you're working construction and you got extra days boy that to me shows you're really willing to work hard to get over this depression okay and the fact that you were able to fill out the testing your thoughts worksheet and that it worked and it helped you feel better the fact that you've gotten your apartment really straightened out all those things are really great yeah okay now let me ask you another question does elias know that you've been depressed i don't know yeah i don't know what he knows i don't know what they've told them right but i mean i guess what do you think of trying to do this one more time but with smiles all right i'll try it okay so i think the attitude you have to have is that you're actually really glad to see elias you connected with him a little bit in the past here's an opportunity to connect with him more strongly what would be good if you did connect with him more strongly well we might do things more together as a family that's right that would be i mean just make us all closer would it mean something to your daughter do you think if you got closer to her parents probably she didn't like that i bet she would like that yeah so is it worth it to really try to put yourself out there and be smiling okay it's hard though right yeah all right so you're gonna get triple credit if you can do this okay so here i am i'm elias i'm sitting here with my wife and i see you i just sort of hey elias how you doing pretty good i haven't seen you for a long time how have you been doing oh pretty well i'm retired now how are you yeah put her a lot around the house and stuff how about you i'm still i'm still trying um i've been doing a little bit of construction and um and i'm i'm actually trying to get back into customer service again because i really liked it when i used to do that and haven't done that so um you know i've been putting in some applications and doing that in the meantime i've been doing a little bit of construction work and volunteering and things like that so you know that's um we'll see we'll see um how it all works out but anyway um so what do you think about the phillies this year i'm so disappointed you know i had high hopes after last season but they're they're not really doing very well yeah i don't know what do you think well they've spent a lot of money on big buck players who aren't paying off is is mostly um what it is so i i don't i don't know i'd like to go to a game sometime but i don't want to spend the money on on on a game if they're if they're just going to be as bad as they've been doing yeah i don't blame you i don't know maybe maybe the eagles will be better this year oh i think that's wishful thinking abe after last season yeah well well maybe they have the quarterback thing straightened out at this point oh yeah i hope so all right let's come out of the role play you did great that was such a difference between the first one and the second one it was hard it was hard feeling like i did that much better but oh boy i have to tell you when i um just looking at your face your your voice was louder i don't know if you know right you really you sounded as if you weren't afraid of what he was going to think you sounded you know and you were just kind of matter of fact talking about the construction and applying for new jobs you weren't negative about it in any way i thought you did a really good job do you have any other topics that you might talk to him with about i mean sport i mean we can always talk about the grandchildren that's always that's a good one easy to talk about and talk about going to some of their activities together maybe oh right or you might see him see him there yeah i don't i don't know how much he goes to um any other topics well our kids of course are one and what they're doing and how they're getting along which which is good you know they're doing really good do they have other children too um yeah they do i think they they have uh i think two other daughters so you could always ask about that yeah you know what topic i find most people like to talk about is travel so have they been any place in the last couple of years or are they planning to go someplace or what's on their bucket list yeah i have trouble talking about that because i haven't gone anywhere done anything so if elias were to say oh yeah we're going to mexico in a couple of months what could you say back to that where are you going to go what are you going to do no that would that would be okay if he would say that that's great i mean and what's on your bucket list abe where would you like to go i i guess the thing is that travel hasn't been the thing that's been most important to me it's just sort of i'm happy to stay close to home and be close with my family i don't really think about going other places well if he asks you you can say that we've never really had the travel bug yeah yeah good all right so what did we talk about in terms of elias that you'd like to remember well i think probably he'll be okay i'm i mean he'll he's certainly gonna be okay want to write some of this down elias will you'll probably be happy to see me and we have com we have common interests to talk about that's true sports kids grandchildren you could ask what he's you know how he's spending his time in retirement now you want to say anything about your appearance how your face might look what your posture might look like i want to stand up straight smile talk loud enough talk with enthusiasm i think it's easier to do when you're talking about your grandchildren yeah yeah that's good much easier than the phillies why is it worth it to do this what will it mean if you do this well i mean it just ties into everything else that we've been talking about and everything i've been doing it's going to help me to just kind of be normal and have a normal life again exactly do you want to write that down or do you think that's really in your head now i'll write it down and uh let's go back to the job application what do you want to write down about that that you know since my last job i want to be able to say that i haven't just been sitting around doing nothing right so when it says list what you're doing what can you enlist i've been doing some stuff on construction been volunteering and i think the way that i'll say it i just want to get back to customer service because i was happy doing that the application do they give you any space to just you know say why you want the job or i think you can talk about yourself different ones are different usually at the end they have a space where you can write something if you want to so this would be a great thing to write get back to customers we really like to do that you really enjoyed it when you were doing it you did it so well you got made supervisor but you're willing to do an entry level job don't do anything just because it's just important to me to work yeah that might be good for you to put in the application too then if there's a space you know something that just occurred to me is that charlie uh was a no not charlie sorry um joseph was your the boss who switched you to inventory right yeah um but he was new in the job as i remember right who was the uh who was your supervisor or boss before joseph that was dan dan and do you think dan would give you a good recommendation yeah i think he probably would so there may be a place on the application to say references maybe you want to give dan's name and number it might be good to um call dan or email him or something beforehand so he'll know to expect a call we have any problem doing that some but i think i can you can you can get yourself to do it that's great so we're giving you some hard things to do i think the application won't be nearly as hard now that we figured out what you could say it might be pretty hard to talk to elias might be pretty hard to call dan right yeah you think you have the strength to be able to do this i'll try i think you do i think you do i think it was pretty impressive how you were able to turn your mood around about your picky i think it's been pretty impressive how much time you've been spending with your family thinking neighbor was easier for me to figure out i think yeah because he he irritates me so and the fact that you're working in construction you're just doing so many good things now abe is there any last thing you want to talk about you got your action plan and firmly in your mind no i think i mean this this is helpful this is i mean i think any problems do you think doing this well i don't know i'll find out but i'm i'm gonna do it i mean these are the kinds of things that even though overall i've been doing better these are the things that i've been stumbling on so and and i don't think we could have worked on these things to be honest with you back in may the fact that we're even working on them now i think is really a testament to you of how how hard you've worked to be able to get to this point even where you could even think about doing these things yeah you think i'm right about that yeah i could i couldn't have talked about these in may yeah and you're going to continue to give yourself credit because that's our standing thing and continue to do uh uh worksheet i find it useful to just keep the rubber band handy to just remind me to at this point it's gotten just sort of kind of a reminder to do all of these things yeah you know what i think this rubber band is i think it's a taking control rubber band good any feedback about the session that was good this was really helpful great thank you all right can i take my copy of the uh the action plan there yeah all right same time next week okay see you then
