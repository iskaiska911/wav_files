oh hi mark hi afternoon afternoon so what would you like to change today on this piece of work I thought what I'd like to talk about is since we did that I wanted to check in with you le Vaillant since we did that piece of work in the in the therapy mouth um yeah Oh in the therapy mouth and yet I felt like the child that I kind of met I put him to bed and I felt really am exhausted kind of physically since and there's been there's been um another process which is feeling a little bit annoyed as well just ask you know with having somebody else to take care of as well as the things I've always had to take off in the past so there's there's been that I suppose I want to feel more energized so today like you'd like to be more than ya feel bit more a bit more nurturing as well towards my you know towards my my lip child off put to bed and so just feel a bit more connected with him really I suppose I'm not like I've just put him to bed and have a rest and you know mine that part of yourself which you put to bed yeah yeah now of course while I was there for questioning here come on you always ask me important questions well let's once expert gone gone and that is how often do you check up on him what is when you've sent him to bed um I'll make you I'll make a conscious effort to you know to perhaps to check on him see where we see ways up to what he's doing probably two or three times a day for you know four times as they maybe you check in with him yeah I just say to him OH what you up to and be okay in yeah just see what he's doing and he's kind of been sleeping sleep a lot recently with another kind of thumb that he's not he's not been present the past couple of days but before that there was like this son around the same time I was like he's kind of screaming kind of child you know like really loud and like yeah that wasn't pleasant but easkey seems these kind of in the different part of my brain difficult my consciousness okay you see mine to be farts of you yeah two children there's one that's asleep and there's the one that's kind of screaming no it's the one that's screaming screaming for recognition from you ah screaming for some other reason it felt like and when I think about it now but it's kind of changed that before it felt like it was screaming he was screaming - he's really angry but now he seemed it seems have calmed down it's just an upset kind of crying or was he angry about being left yeah but it felt very kind of thought for me on the it felt vapor circuitry you know I have this image of you know jaws like his mouth wide open and just shouting at me because it's been left yeah you know a bit overpowering as well you know kind of like which was about while I kind of just felt really overwhelmed I suppose with the noise he was making so what happened when you felt that when you felt overwhelmed hmm what did you do I tried sir than him I tried doing all you know you'll be okay and I that seemed to work George kind of saying to more you know you give your eye and then sometimes I just kind of recoiled it you know like it's too much what you thinking when you smell what you're thinking I was I was doing I was kind of taking you out really I was always does Lori checking I was checking out whether this was making sense oh yeah what you were thinking because it sounds a bit kind of from slowly it's that old kind of thing isn't it the the parental messages about this being odd and kind of thing so I suppose I was just checking that out really with you so how do you like my response yeah I would yeah oh good I'm pleased about yeah what you're saying so you want to be more energized that's one for this piece of work hmm I know what you're aware of is there's two parts of you I was like two kids in a way one is silent when you're gone screaming art and the other one screaming a lot because it wants to get recognition from you and that is angry yeah was your honor giving that recognition yeah and you occasionally look in temp to soothe the one face yeah yeah oh ah well both of them but it's easier for me to smooth soothe the one that's asleep oh how come because of his fevers not gonna hear you it smells a bit yeah yeah I'm not thought of in that way I supposed to be at me was just checking that he was still okay you know you asleep you've been a you been asleep a long time kind of thing in on the other one you still go through say it's okay so came here yeah yeah you no need to be so angry though yeah do you do that no I don't put it in those words what do you do that I can I say to him wrong they'll be okay oh you'll be all you'll be okay Annabeth I don't don't talk to him in that frame you know you don't have to be so angry kind of thing so one of these time for you to get more energy I think after I have to feel less scared of these two now give me scared of the both like the other ones asleep what do you mean scared of the other one or scared want to sleep or both of them I think how come you're scared of one that's asleep just scared of what might happen you know if I wake wake him up and what could happen that I won't be able to don't bear to look after him properly and the other one is angry here you scared of him as well yeah let's get him because he's he's kind of fun I thought that you know if I can't shut him up this doesn't sound of a good way putting it but if I can't see them too you know kind of you sure I was thinking that about just I'm sure there's a connection but recently I wouldn't just focus go to bad just um tell you it kind of really shaky you know like um I guess it's not like it's not a pleasant experience again preparing to go to bed and I thought about the tree being connected before but maybe they are so it's not a good experience nice experience you said no getting ready for bed a lot kind of paranoid toss you know but you know kind of waking up from being sick in the night kind of you know and being poisoned anything Oh who'd want to poison you mm-hm I once I don't know but you might know you might not know to
